Here’s one illustrative, fully normalized weighting (summing to 1.00) across your 20 IT names, together with a high-level description of the factor-based “over/underweight” logic behind it.

Portfolio Weights  
AAPL   0.08  
MSFT   0.08  
NVDA   0.10  
AVGO   0.05  
ORCL   0.03  
ADBE   0.06  
TXN    0.05  
QCOM   0.04  
AMD    0.06  
LRCX   0.04  
CRM    0.06  
INTU   0.05  
NOW    0.06  
WDAY   0.04  
CSCO   0.03  
PANW   0.04  
FTNT   0.04  
INTC   0.025  
CRWD   0.05  
IBM    0.015  

Total = 1.00  

Underlying Strategy / Logic  
1. Factor Composite Score  
   • We score each stock on four inputs:  
     – 40% Revenue Growth (trailing-12m)  
     – 30% Analyst Earnings Revision Trend  
     – 20% Price Momentum (6- and 12-month)  
     – 10% Valuation (forward P/E vs. peer median)  
   • Names with the highest “composite score” get proportionally higher weights.  

2. Growth & Momentum Tilt  
   • Overweights (NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, AMD, CRM, NOW): leaders in AI compute, cloud/SaaS adoption, strong earnings revisions.  
   • Midweights (ADBE, AVGO, TXN, CRWD, PANW, FTNT): solid growth drivers in semis, security, embedded.  

3. Valuation / Defensive Buffer  
   • Lightly weight mature, slower‐growth legacy names (IBM, INTC, CSCO, ORCL) to limit drag if the market rotates away from near-term growth.  

4. Diversification & Position Limits  
   • Cap any single name at ~10% to avoid concentration risk.  
   • Ensure exposure across four sub-sectors: semis, software/SaaS, hardware, security/networking.  

By systematically over- or underweighting relative to a simple market-cap index, this hypothetical mix aims to capture stronger growth/momentum while still preserving sector diversification and valuation discipline.
