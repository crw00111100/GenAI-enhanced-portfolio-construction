Below is one possible “tilted”‐weighting of the 20 Consumer-Staples names (weights sum to 1.00).  In this example we tilt toward:  
 • Large-moat, high-margin “franchise” names with pricing power (PEP, KO, PG)  
 • Faster-growing or ecommerce‐leveraged staples (COST, WMT, EL, MDLZ)  
 • Select undervalued or improving margin food brands (CHD, STZ, GIS)  
 • A modest allocation to tobacco (PM, MO) for yield—but kept low given regulatory risk

Rationale/Strategy  
1) Quality/Growth tilt:  Overweight industry leaders with strong brand loyalty, pricing power and consistent volume growth (PEP, KO, PG).  
2) E-commerce exposure:  Larger‐format and membership‐based retailers (COST, WMT) benefit disproportionately from online grocery adoption.  
3) Faster‐growing snacks/beauty:  Premium snack/health (EL, MDLZ) and confectionery (HSY) companies tend to outpace the category average.  
4) Value/distressed:  Select “turnaround” or temporarily underpriced staples (CHD, STZ, GIS) where margin improvement or cost synergies are in motion.  
5) Diversifier/Yield:  A small allocation to high-yield but regulatory-sensitive tobacco names (PM, MO) to boost income and diversify cash flows, without overly raising sector risk.  
6) Risk controls:  By underweighting mid-tier or highly cyclical staples (e.g., KHC, SJM) and keeping no one name above ~9%, we limit idiosyncratic drawdowns.  

This blend of quality, growth, value and yield—along with modest regulatory-risk exposure—aims to capture upside drivers of the staples space while controlling volatility, potentially outperforming a cap-weighted SP500-30 staples benchmark over a full cycle.
