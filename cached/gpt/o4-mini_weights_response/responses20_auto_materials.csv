Here’s one possible “factor-tilted” allocation across the 20 names you gave.  Weights sum to 100%.  The idea is to overweight higher-quality, higher-free-cash-flow names with secular tailwinds, while still maintaining some cyclical/value exposure.

Proposed weights  
APD  (Air Products)           8%  
LIN  (Linde)                     8%  
SHW  (Sherwin-Williams)       7%  
ECL  (Ecolab)                     7%  
CF   (CF Industries)           6%  
PPG  (PPG Industries)          6%  
ALB  (Albemarle)                5%  
NUE  (Nucor)                     5%  
NEM  (Newmont)                  5%  
FCX  (Freeport-McMoRan)      5%  
VMC  (Vulcan Materials)        5%  
DOW  (Dow)                         4%  
DD   (DuPont)                     4%  
CTVA (Corteva)                  4%  
MLM  (Martin Marietta)        4%  
IFF  (International Flavors)  4%  
MOS  (Mosaic)                     4%  
PKG  (Packaging Corp)         3%  
IP   International Paper       3%  
EMN  (Eastman Chemical)      3%  
TOTAL                             100%

Underlying strategy/logic  
1. Quality & cash‐flow tilt (50%+):  
   • Air Products, Linde, Sherwin, Ecolab, CF, PPG – leaders in pricing power & FCF yield  
2. Secular growth/value blend (25%):  
   • Albemarle (Li-battery materials), Nucor (domestic steel), Newmont (gold as inflation hedge)  
3. Cyclical recovery/value (20%):  
   • Freeport, Vulcan, Dow, DuPont, Corteva, Martin Marietta, IFF – levered to industrial/commodity upcycles  
4. Risk‐diversifiers (5%):  
   • Mosaic, Packaging Corp, Int’l Paper, Eastman – smaller, more idiosyncratic niches  

By overweighting the higher-quality, pricing-power names and underweighting the more volatile, pure‐commodity plays, this tilt seeks to capture upside in both steady secular growth and cyclical rebounds—while dampening drawdowns if raw materials prices roll over.
