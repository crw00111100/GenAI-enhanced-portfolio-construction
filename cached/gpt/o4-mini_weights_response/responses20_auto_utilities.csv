Below is one possible “active‐tilt” allocation across your 20 stock universe. In this hypothetical portfolio we combine three sub‐strategies—Growth/Momentum, Dividend/Yield and ESG/Decarbonization—while capping any single name at 10% to control idiosyncratic risk, and ensuring full diversification (weights sum to 100%).

1. Portfolio Weights

Ticker  Weight  (%)   Rationale  
NEE     10.0        Leader in renewable generation; highest earnings growth and ESG score  
D       8.0         Stable dividend compounder, strong regulated footprint  
EXC     8.0         Accelerating decarbonization investments, improving ROE  
DUK     7.0         Highly regulated, steady cashflow, diversified across Carolinas  
SO      7.0         Above‐market yield, improving operating efficiency  
AEP     6.0         Consistent dividend growth, strong regulatory relationships  
ED      6.0         Low leverage, stable cashflows in Northeast  
ES      6.0         Fast‐growing renewables arm, attractive valuation  
XEL     5.0         Value tilt, solid balance sheet, clean‐energy roadmap  
EVRG    5.0         Mid‐South focus, good yield and modest growth outlook  
PPL     4.0         Deep‐value dividend opportunity, planned rate-base expansions  
WEC     4.0         Exposure to Midwest growth markets, reasonable valuation  
CNP     4.0         Lean cost structure, above‐average dividend yield  
AEE     3.0         Florida‐focused, hurricane‐resilience investments driving upside  
SRE     3.0         Competitive yields, stable earnings in Sun Belt markets  
AWK     3.0         Pure‐play water utility (defensive), modest growth  
PNW     3.0         Northwest regulated utility with steady returns  
CMS     3.0         New Mexico/Florida exposure, attractive valuation  
PEG     3.0         Twin electric/gas utility, improving operational metrics  
FE      2.0         Lowest weight—regional focus, higher risk from weather events  

  TOTAL 100.0

2. Underlying Strategy and Logic

•  Growth/Momentum (≈ 40% total)  
   – Overweight NEE, EXC, ES, EVRG, DUK for above‐average rate‐base growth, renewables build­out and earnings momentum.  
•  Dividend/Yield (≈ 40% total)  
   – Tilt toward the highest‐quality dividend growers (D, SO, AEP, ED, XEL, PPL). These names offer a blend of yield and safety in a rising­rate environment.  
•  ESG/Decarbonization (≈ 20% total)  
   – Reward utilities with best‐in‐class carbon reduction targets and clean‐energy roadmaps: NEE, EXC, ES, XEL and EVRG.  
•  Risk Controls  
   – No single position > 10%.  
   – Minimum position size 2% to capture idiosyncratic upside (FE at 2%).  
   – Annual rebalance to maintain targeted factor exposures and trim any >10% drifts.

This is purely illustrative. In practice you’d overlay your own forecasts for rate cases, macro outlook, regulatory risk, balance‐sheet targets and execution on renewables/capex.
