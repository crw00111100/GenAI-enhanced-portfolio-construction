Here’s one illustrative way to tilt a 20-name Consumer Discretionary sleeve away from a straight market-cap index and towards a higher-conviction, growth-and-momentum-tilted portfolio.  All weights sum to 100%.

1. High-Conviction Growth/Momentum (59%)  
  • AMZN 10%  
  • TSLA 9%  
  • HD   8%  
  • LOW  7%  
  • LULU 7%  
  • ULTA 6%  
  • NKE  6%  
  • BKNG 6%  

2. Secular Recovery & Specialty (20%)  
  • CMG  5%  
  • MAR  5%  
  • TJX  5%  
  • ROST 5%  

3. Staple Restaurants & Food (6%)  
  • MCD  3%  
  • SBUX 3%  

4. Auto Aftermarket & Specialty Retail (7%)  
  • ORLY 4%  
  • AZO  3%  

5. Smaller/Turnaround/Core (8%)  
  • YUM  2%  
  • KMX  2%  
  • EBAY 2%  
  • WYNN 2%  

TOTAL = 100%

Underlying Logic  
• Conviction-Weighted Approach: Rank the 20 names by a composite “quality + momentum + growth” score, then overweight the top quartile (AMZN, TSLA, HD, LOW, LULU, ULTA, NKE, BKNG) at ~60% total.  
• Secular Themes: Allocate to travel/hospitality recoverers (BKNG, MAR) and specialty/high-margin operators (CMG, ULTA).  
• Diversification: Retain position sizes in staple restaurants (MCD, SBUX), after-market (ORLY, AZO) and smaller/turnaround names for idiosyncratic balance.  
• Risk Management: By capping the 4 smallest positions at 2% each, we limit single-name blowups while still capturing potential upside.  
• Aim: Overweighting high-growth, high-momentum, structurally advantaged names while maintaining broad exposure across the Consumer Discretionary sub-sectors.
