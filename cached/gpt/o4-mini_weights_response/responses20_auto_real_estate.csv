Here’s one possible “tilt‐to‐growth” allocation that sums to 100% (1.00) and overweights secular themes (data centers, cell towers, logistics) while underweighting more challenged retail/office names.  The goal is to capture higher-growth, long-duration cash flows and demographic tailwinds.

Portfolio Weights (percentages)  
DLR (Digital Realty)  10%  
EQIX (Equinix)     9%  
PSA (Public Storage)  7%  
CCI (Crown Castle)   9%  
AMT (American Tower)  7%  
SBAC (SBA Communications) 6%  
PLD (Prologis)     8%  
EXR (Extra Space Storage) 6%  
AVB (AvalonBay Communities) 8%  
EQR (Equity Residential) 6%  
MAA (Mid-America Apt. Cmn) 5%  
WELL (Welltower)    3%  
IRM (Iron Mountain)   3%  
VTR (Ventas)     4%  
HST (Host Hotels)   2%  
SPG (Simon Property)  3%  
FRT (Federal Realty)  2%  
KIM (Kimco)     1%  
BXP (Boston Properties) 1%  

Total        100%

Underlying Strategy/Logic  
1. Overweight Digital Infrastructure (40% total: DLR, EQIX, PSA, plus data/storage specialist IRM)  
   – Secular growth in cloud computing, edge, 5G, long-term leases, high recurring revenue.  
2. Overweight Telecom Towers (22%: CCI, AMT, SBAC)  
   – 5G roll-out, densification, technology-driven usage growth.  
3. Overweight Industrial/Logistics (PLD 8%)  
   – E-commerce, supply-chain onshoring, cold storage potential.  
4. Overweight Residential/Multi-Family (19%: AVB, EQR, MAA)  
   – Demographic tailwinds, rent inflation, affordable housing shortages.  
5. Selective Exposure to Specialty REITs (WELL, VTR, EXR, IRM) 16%  
   – Healthcare seniors living, self-storage, information storage—niches with stable demand.  
6. Underweight Retail & Office (SPG, FRT, KIM, BXP, HST combined 12%)  
   – Structural headwinds in brick-and-mortar malls, suburban retail, office re-entry risks.

By tilting toward higher-growth, longer-duration Property Sectors and away from more cyclical or structurally challenged areas, the model aims to outperform a market-cap–weighted S&P 500-60 Real Estate index over a full cycle—while still maintaining diversification across 20 names.
