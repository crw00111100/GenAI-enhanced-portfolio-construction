Here’s one illustrative way you might tilt a 20-stock Communication Services sleeve toward higher-growth, “quality” names while keeping broad subsector diversification. All weights sum to 1.00.

1. Equity weights (decimal, rounded):  
   META   0.16  
   GOOGL  0.10  
   GOOG   0.10  
   NFLX   0.11  
   DIS    0.10  
   EA     0.05  
   TTWO   0.05  
   TMUS   0.06  
   T      0.05  
   VZ     0.04  
   CMCSA  0.06  
   MTCH   0.03  
   FOXA   0.01  
   FOX    0.01  
   PARA   0.01  
   WBD    0.01  
   CHTR   0.01  
   IPG    0.005  
   OMC    0.005  
   LYV    0.03  

2. Underlying strategy & logic  
 - Growth/Quality Tilt: Overweight platform leaders with strong moats, secular ad-tech tailwinds and high free-cash-flow visibility (META, Alphabet A & C shares).  
 - Streaming/Content: Captain holdings in Netflix and Disney to capture continued streaming monetization and IP leverage.  
 - Gaming Exposure: Mid-caps EA and Take-Two for recurring-revenue game franchises.  
 - Select Telecom Tilt: Moderate stakes in T, VZ for yield and TMUS for 5G growth.  
 - Broad Media/Ad Agencies: Mid-single-digit (or sub-1%) “satellites” in Comcast, Match, Charter, smaller cable nets (FOXA/FOX/Para/WBD) and ad-agency IPG/OMC to round out the theme.  
 - Risk Budgeting & Conviction Sizing: Larger positions in highest-conviction, high-return-on-capital franchises; micro-positions in lower-conviction or higher-volatility names.  

This blend aims to outperform a simple “equal-weight” or market-cap index by tilting into higher-growth, higher-quality businesses while still preserving exposure to the full Communication Services ecosystem.
