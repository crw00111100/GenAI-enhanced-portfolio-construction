Below is one possible “over-/underweight” allocation across the 20 financial names.  All weights sum to 1.00 (i.e. 100%), and the broad idea is to tilt toward higher-ROE, fee-based franchises (exchanges, asset managers, high-quality banks), moderate exposure to cyclical lenders, and underweight more rate-sensitive or low-return insurers.

Rationale/Strategy  
1. Quality tilt: overweight JPM, GS and BLK for strong ROE, capital generation and leading market franchises.  
2. Fee-based bias: premium on exchanges (ICE, CME) and asset managers (BLK, SCHW, TROW) to capture secular fee growth and lower credit sensitivity.  
3. Balanced bank exposure: moderate weights in BAC, PNC, USB; underweight more rate-cyclical lender C.  
4. Selective investment banking: GS and MS receive a combined ~17% for fixed-income/capital-markets upside.  
5. Insurance diversification: TRV and MMC moderate weights for balanced underwriting profiles; PRU/MET smaller weights given legacy liabilities and lower ROE.  
6. Consumer finance underweight: AXP/COF get modest exposure reflecting consumer-loan cyclicality.  

This hypothetical blend aims to outperform a cap-weighted “SP500‐40 financials” index by tilting into higher-quality, fee-driven sub-industries and dialing back lower-ROE, credit-sensitive names.
