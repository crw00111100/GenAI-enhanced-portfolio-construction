Below is one illustrative way to allocate 100% of your model-energy portfolio across the fifteen names, together with the rough “buckets” and factor tilts behind it.  It is purely hypothetical – you should run your own due diligence before putting real capital to work.

1. Sector / Business‐model Buckets  
   a) Upstream producers (leverage to oil price) … 33%  
   b) Integrated majors & refiners (stability, free cash flow) … 22%  
   c) Midstream (fee‐based cash flows, dividend yield) … 14%  
   d) Refiners (crack‐spread exposure) … 11%  
   e) Oilfield services & equipment (offshore/onshore capex recovery) … 20%  

2. Factor Tilts  
   – Overweight “upstream” to capture commodity upside when oil rallies  
   – Overweight select services for a turn in capex cycle offshore/onshore  
   – Underweight pure refiners (higher margin risk when spreads compress)  
   – Moderate weight to large integrated majors for ballast and liquidity  
   – Add midstream for yield and low‐vol fee structures  

3. Resulting Weights (summing to 100%)  
   Upstream (33%)  
     • EOG : 8%  
     • COP : 8%  
     • APA : 6%  
     • DVN : 6%  
     • OXY : 5%  

   Integrated majors & Marketing (22%)  
     • XOM : 8%  
     • CVX : 8%  
     • PSX : 6%  

   Midstream & Pipelines (14%)  
     • KMI : 8%  
     • OKE : 6%  

   Refiners (11%)  
     • MPC : 6%  
     • VLO : 5%  

   Oilfield Services & Equipment (20%)  
     • SLB : 8%  
     • BKR : 6%  
     • HAL : 6%  

Why this might outperform a cap-weighted “S&P 500 Energy” index:  
– By overweighting upstream you gain more when crude rises.  
– By overweighting services you exploit a cyclical capex rebound.  
– By allocating to midstream you pick up stable, bond-like distributions.  
– By underweighting pure refiners you reduce risk from volatile crack spreads.  
– By keeping a modest core in XOM/CVX you retain liquidity and draw on balance‐sheet strength.  

All weights normalize to 100%; you can of course tweak the factor tilts, rebalance periodically, or overlay risk controls depending on your views.
