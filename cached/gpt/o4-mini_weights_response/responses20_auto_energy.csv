Here’s one possible “tilted” weighting scheme (weights sum to 1.00) across the 20 stocks, designed to blend quality, growth/momentum, income and sub‐sector diversification in order to potentially outperform a straight equal‐weight or market‐cap energy index:

Portfolio Weights  
XOM – 0.11  
CVX – 0.11  
COP – 0.07  
EOG – 0.07  
APA – 0.04  
DVN – 0.05  
OXY – 0.03  
FANG – 0.05  
EQT – 0.04  
SLB – 0.05  
HAL – 0.03  
BKR – 0.02  
KMI – 0.05  
WMB – 0.05  
OKE – 0.02  
PSX – 0.06  
VLO – 0.04  
HES – 0.03  
CTRA – 0.02  
MPC – 0.06  

Total = 1.00  

Underlying Strategy/Logic  
1. Quality “Anchor” (22%): XOM & CVX (0.11 each) are global integrated majors with strong free‐cash‐flow, solid balance sheets and healthy dividends—bolstering the portfolio’s stability.  
2. Growth/Momentum Tilt (COP, EOG, FANG, DVN, APA, EQT = 0.07, 0.07, 0.05, 0.05, 0.04, 0.04): Overweight producers with recent production growth, strong cash‐flow per share momentum or favorable shale‐asset positions.  
3. Refining & Midstream Yielders (PSX, MPC, KMI, WMB, OKE, CTRA = 0.06, 0.06, 0.05, 0.05, 0.02, 0.02): Capture refinery‐margin recovery and stable fee‐based revenue; these names also offer above‐average distributions.  
4. Selective Services Exposure (SLB, HAL = 0.05, 0.03; BKR = 0.02): A modest bet on an uptick in energy capex—balanced so that if equipment spending disappoints, the drag is limited.  
5. Underweight Higher‐Risk/High‐Debt (OXY, HES = 0.03 each): Smaller allocations to more leveraged/or higher‐volatility E&P names to limit balance‐sheet risk.  

By blending these sub‐sector tilts—“quality anchors,” mid‐cap growth, income‐oriented pipelines & refineries, plus a calibrated services stake—this hypothetical portfolio aims to:  
• Capture upside when commodity prices and refining margins recover (E&P, refiners)  
• Benefit from steady cash flows & dividends (majors, pipelines)  
• Mitigate downside (underweight high‐debt names; quality bias)  
• Maintain some cyclical leverage (service providers) without overexposure  

All weights are normalized so that the total equals 1.00.
