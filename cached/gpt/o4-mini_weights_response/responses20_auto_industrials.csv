Here’s one way you might “tilt” a 20-stock S&P 500 Industrials portfolio toward higher-growth, more defensive or cash-generative names while underweighting the most cyclical names.  All weights sum to 1.00:

Ticker    Weight  
LMT       0.10  
RTX       0.09  
NOC       0.08  
HON       0.08  
UNP       0.07  
PH        0.06  
CAT       0.06  
DE        0.06  
MMM       0.05  
CSX       0.05  
FDX       0.04  
UPS       0.04  
EXPD      0.04  
ITW       0.04  
EMR       0.03  
ETN       0.03  
ROK       0.03  
NSC       0.01  
CMI       0.02  
BA        0.02  

Total     1.00  

Underlying strategy/logic:  
1.   Overweight “defensive” subsectors—defense primes (LMT, RTX, NOC) with long order backlogs and stable government spending.  
2.   Overweight high-margin, automation & instrumentation (HON, PH, ITW, EMR, ETN, ROK) benefiting from continued factory automation, reshoring and infrastructure spend.  
3.   Overweight select transportation/rail (UNP, CSX) for secular growth in intermodal freight.  
4.   Modest positions in logistics integrators (FDX, UPS, EXPD) on e-commerce growth and pricing power.  
5.   Underweight heavy cyclicals (CAT, DE) and airlines (BA), which are more exposed to volatile commodity and travel cycles.  
6.   Mid-caps (MMM, CMI, NSC) get smaller “satellite” weights, reflecting mixed end markets.  

By tilting toward higher-quality cash flows, secular growth themes and more defensive sub-sectors you aim to reduce cycle risk and potentially outperform a straight cap-weighted industrials index during both soft (defense, automation) and stronger (rail, logistics) demand regimes.
