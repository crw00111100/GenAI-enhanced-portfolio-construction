### Underlying Strategy & Logic

#### 1. **Quality Tilt & Growth Bias**
- **Overweighted**: LIN, SHW, APD, ECL  
  These are large-cap, high-quality companies with strong balance sheets, global reach, and consistent earnings growth. Historically, they have outperformed the sector and are less volatile, providing portfolio stability.

#### 2. **Cyclical/Commodity Exposure**
- **Moderate Weights**: NEM, FCX, NUE, MLM, VMC  
  These companies are more sensitive to commodity prices and economic cycles. By giving them moderate weights, the portfolio captures potential upside during economic expansions without being overly exposed to cyclicality.

#### 3. **Future Themes (Green Transition, Electrification, Food Security)**
- **Above-average Weights**: ALB (lithium for EVs), MOS & CF (fertilizers for agriculture)  
  These names are positioned to benefit from long-term secular trends, such as the energy transition and global food demand.

#### 4. **Diversification Across Sub-sectors**
- **Smaller Weights**: BALL, PKG, IFF, AVY, EMN, CTVA, IP, PPG  
  These provide exposure to packaging, specialty chemicals, and agricultural inputs, supporting diversification and reducing single-factor risk.

#### 5. **Risk Management**
- Lower weights are assigned to companies with higher volatility, weaker fundamentals, or more cyclical earnings (e.g., IP, PPG, EMN, CTVA).

#### 6. **Potential to Outperform**
- By overweighting quality growth names and future-facing themes, while still maintaining cyclical exposure, the portfolio aims to outperform the S&P 500-15 Materials index, which is often market-cap weighted and thus more concentrated in a few names.

**Summary:**  
This allocation emphasizes quality and growth, diversifies across sub-sectors, and tactically tilts toward future-oriented materials themes. It seeks to balance stability, upside potential, and risk, aiming for outperformance versus a simple cap-weighted index.
