### Underlying Strategy & Logic

**1. Tilt Toward Growth and Innovation (LLY, VRTX, REGN, TMO):**
- **Higher weights to LLY, VRTX, REGN, TMO:** These companies have demonstrated strong revenue/earnings growth, robust pipelines, and leadership in high-growth therapeutic areas (e.g., obesity, rare diseases, biotech innovation, life science tools).
- **Rationale:** Growth stocks tend to outperform over the long term, especially in sectors with innovation tailwinds.

**2. Maintain Core Exposure to Blue-Chip Leaders (JNJ, UNH, ABBV, MRK):**
- **Significant weights to JNJ, UNH, ABBV, MRK:** These are diversified, stable, large-cap companies with strong balance sheets and defensive characteristics.
- **Rationale:** These stocks anchor the portfolio, providing stability and lower volatility, which is important for risk-adjusted outperformance.

**3. Underweight Slower-Growth and Challenged Names (PFE, BMY, GILD):**
- **Lower weights to PFE, BMY, GILD:** These companies face patent cliffs, slower growth, or execution challenges.
- **Rationale:** Reducing exposure to laggards improves the potential for outperformance.

**4. Selective Bet on Managed Care (UNH, CI, HUM):**
- **Higher weight to UNH, moderate to CI and HUM:** Managed care has secular growth and pricing power, but UNH is the clear leader.
- **Rationale:** Focus on the strongest player while maintaining some diversification.

**5. Diversification Across Sub-sectors:**
- **Exposure to medical devices (ISRG, SYK, MDT, EW):** Allocated modest weights to device makers, balancing innovation with valuation concerns.
- **Exposure to distributors (MCK):** Small but meaningful allocation for defensive growth.

**6. Limit Concentration Risk:**
- No single stock exceeds 13% of the portfolio, and the top 5 holdings comprise less than 50%, ensuring diversification.

### Summary

This portfolio is **growth-tilted** (overweighting innovative pharma/biotech and life sciences), **anchored by blue-chip stability**, and **underweight in challenged or slow-growth names**. The approach aims to outperform the S&P 500 Health Care sector by capturing both stability and upside from innovation, while mitigating risks from secular decliners.
