### Underlying Strategy and Logic

#### 1. **Core-Satellite Approach**
- **Core Holdings**: Heavier weights (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA) are assigned to the largest, most stable, and consistently high-performing tech giants. These form the "core" and provide stability and broad tech market exposure.
- **Satellite Positions**: Medium allocations (AVGO, AMD, CRM, ADBE, NOW) target companies with strong growth prospects, innovation, and/or market leadership in their niches.
- **Tactical Overweights**: Slightly higher weights (relative to market cap) to high-growth, high-momentum stocks (e.g., NVDA, AMD) that have shown strong earnings growth and potential for outperformance.
- **Diversification**: Smaller allocations to mature, cyclical, or lower-volatility stocks (e.g., CSCO, TXN, MCHP) for diversification and risk management.

#### 2. **Tilt Toward Growth and Innovation**
- The portfolio is overweight on companies driving major technological shifts (AI, cloud, cybersecurity, semiconductors), such as NVDA, AMD, NOW, PANW, and FTNT.
- Underweights (relative to index) on legacy or slower-growing firms (e.g., CSCO, TXN) to reduce drag on performance.

#### 3. **Risk Management**
- No single stock exceeds 13% to avoid excessive concentration risk.
- Exposure is spread across subsectors: software (CRM, ADBE, NOW, CDNS, SNPS), semiconductors (NVDA, AVGO, AMD, KLAC, MCHP, TXN), IT services (ACN), and networking (CSCO, ANET).

#### 4. **Potential Outperformance Factors**
- Overweighting high-growth, high-innovation stocks aims to capture outperformance relative to a traditional market-cap weighted index.
- The blend of stability (AAPL, MSFT), innovation (NVDA, AMD, NOW, PANW), and diversification should help manage volatility while targeting higher returns.
