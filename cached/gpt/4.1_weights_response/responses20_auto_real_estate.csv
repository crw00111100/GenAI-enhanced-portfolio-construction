## Underlying Strategy & Logic

**1. Overweight Structural Winners (Secular Growth)**
- **PLD, AMT, EQIX, DLR, PSA, SBAC, ARE:** These companies are leaders in logistics, data centers, towers, and life sciences. Sectors like logistics (PLD), data centers (EQIX, DLR), cell towers (AMT, SBAC), and life science real estate (ARE) have strong secular demand drivers (e-commerce, cloud, 5G, biotech).
- These are given higher weights (7-10%) to capture above-market growth.

**2. Core Income REITs**
- **O, SPG, WELL, VTR, AVB:** These are diversified or sector-leading REITs with stable income and/or resilient business models (e.g., O for net lease, SPG for high-quality malls, WELL/VTR for healthcare, AVB for multifamily).
- Moderate weights (4-6%) for stability and yield.

**3. Diversification Among Residential, Healthcare, and Retail**
- **EQR, ESS, EXR, KIM, FRT, REG:** These provide exposure to residential, storage, and retail. Given slightly lower weights (2-3.5%) to balance growth and risk.

**4. Underweight Headwinds/Transition**
- **CCI:** Although a major tower REIT, currently faces headwinds (e.g., tenant consolidation, lower growth vs. AMT/SBAC). Thus, underweighted (1%).
- **CBRE:** As a real estate services firm, less direct real estate ownership, so lower weight (2%).

**5. Risk Management**
- No single position above 10% to avoid concentration risk.
- Portfolio is tilted toward secular growth and defensive income, while still maintaining broad sector diversification.

## Summary of Approach

- **Overweight growth subsectors:** Industrial, data centers, towers, life science.
- **Maintain exposure to stable income:** Net lease, healthcare, multifamily.
- **Underweight challenged or cyclical areas:** Some
