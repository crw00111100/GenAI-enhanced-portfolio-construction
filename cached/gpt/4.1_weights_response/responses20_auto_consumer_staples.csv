## Allocation Strategy & Rationale

**Objective:**  
To potentially outperform the S&P 500-30 Consumer Staples index by overweighting quality compounders, defensive growth, and companies with strong pricing power, while underweighting slower-growth, more cyclical, or structurally challenged names.

### Key Principles Used

1. **Overweight Quality Compounders:**  
   - Large weights to **PG, COST, WMT, KO, PEP**â€”these are global leaders, resilient in downturns, with consistent earnings growth and pricing power.
   - **Rationale:** These companies tend to outperform in volatile markets and offer steady returns.

2. **Diversification Across Sub-sectors:**  
   - Balanced exposure to food & beverage (KO, PEP, HSY, MDLZ, STZ, TAP, MKC, K, CAG, CPB), household & personal care (PG, CL, KMB, CHD, EL), retail/wholesale (COST, WMT, KR, SYY), and healthcare/consumer health (WBA).
   - **Rationale:** Reduces idiosyncratic risk and ensures portfolio is not overly exposed to any single sub-sector.

3. **Growth Tilt:**  
   - Slightly higher weights for companies with higher expected growth (COST, MDLZ, STZ, HSY).
   - **Rationale:** Seeks to capture upside from secular growth trends.

4. **Underweight Challenged or Low-Growth Names:**  
   - Lower weights for **WBA, CPB, K** due to structural challenges or slower growth prospects.
   - **Rationale:** Reduces drag from potential underperformers.

5. **Risk Management:**  
   - No single stock exceeds 11% weight, keeping concentration risk in check.
   - **Rationale:** Avoids overexposure to any one company.

### Summary

This allocation is slightly more concentrated in high-quality, resilient leaders, and tilts away from structurally challenged or slow-growing names. The approach seeks to combine stability (defensive stalwarts) with a modest growth tilt, aiming for risk-adjusted outperformance relative to a cap-weighted consumer staples index.

**Note:**  
This is a hypothetical allocation for illustrative purposes and does not constitute investment advice. Actual outperformance would depend on future market conditions and company performance.
