### Underlying Strategy & Logic

**1. Quality & Growth Tilt:**  
A larger allocation is given to high-quality, growth-oriented utilities such as **NEE (NextEra Energy)**, **SO (Southern Company)**, **DUK (Duke Energy)**, and **AEP (American Electric Power)**. These companies have a track record of stable earnings, strong balance sheets, and have been leaders in renewable energy transition, which can lead to outperformance.

**2. Diversification:**  
While the largest weights are assigned to the most stable and innovative companies, the portfolio still maintains exposure to mid-sized and smaller utilities for diversification and to capture potential upside from regional growth or M&A activity.

**3. Defensive Water Utility Tilt:**  
A slightly higher weight is given to **AWK (American Water Works)**, which provides exposure to the water utility sector—a segment with stable, regulated returns and less sensitivity to energy price swings.

**4. Reduced Exposure to High-Leverage/Low-Growth:**  
Stocks with higher debt, regulatory risk, or slower growth prospects (e.g., **FE, ED, ATO**) are underweighted, as these may lag in a rising rate or more competitive environment.

**5. ESG & Renewables Focus:**  
A preference is shown for companies leading in ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) initiatives and renewables (e.g., **NEE, XEL, SRE**), as these are likely to benefit from secular trends and investor inflows.

**6. Factor Diversification:**  
The portfolio balances between value (e.g., **D, PEG**) and growth (e.g., **NEE, SRE**), aiming for a defensive posture with some growth kicker.

### Summary

This allocation aims to **outperform the index** by overweighting high-quality, growth, and ESG leaders, while maintaining broad diversification and underweighting lower-growth, higher-risk names. The weights reflect a blend of market cap, quality, growth, and ESG tilt, which historically has been a recipe for modest outperformance in the utilities sector.
