### Underlying Strategy:

1. **Market Leadership and Growth Potential**:
   - Higher weights are given to companies with strong market positions (e.g., LIN, APD, ALB) and exposure to high-growth industries such as EVs (ALB) and infrastructure (VMC, MLM, NUE).

2. **Diversification Across Sub-Sectors**:
   - Allocations are spread across sub-sectors like industrial gases, chemicals, coatings, fertilizers, aggregates, steel, and packaging to reduce concentration risk.

3. **Thematic Exposure**:
   - Companies benefiting from long-term themes like sustainability (BALL, AVY), electrification (ALB, FCX), and infrastructure spending (NUE, STLD, VMC, MLM) receive higher weights.

4. **Defensive Plays**:
   - Defensive companies like ECL, IFF, and NEM are included to provide stability during market downturns.

5. **Risk Management**:
   - Lower weights are assigned to more cyclical or volatile stocks (e.g., MOS, IP, BALL) to balance the portfolio's risk-reward profile.

6. **Relative Valuation and Momentum**:
   - Companies with attractive valuations and strong recent performance (e.g., NUE, STLD, ALB) are slightly overweighted compared to peers in their sub-sector.

### Total Allocation:
The weights add up to **100% (or 1.00)**. This portfolio aims to balance growth, diversification, and risk management to potentially outperform the SP500-15 materials index over the medium to long term.
