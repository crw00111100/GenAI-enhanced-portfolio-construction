1. **High-Growth Leaders (Core Allocation - 37%)**  
   - **AMZN (15%)**: Amazon is a dominant e-commerce and cloud-computing leader with immense growth potential. Its weight reflects its strong market position and ability to drive long-term returns.  
   - **TSLA (12%)**: Tesla has a strong position in the EV market and renewable energy space, making it a key growth driver in the consumer discretionary sector.  
   - **HD (10%)**: Home Depot benefits from housing and renovation trends, providing a mix of growth and stability.

2. **Consumer Staples-Like Stability (Complementary Allocation - 32%)**  
   - **NKE (8%)**: Nike is a leader in athletic apparel and footwear, with a strong brand and consistent performance.  
   - **MCD (7%)**: McDonald's is a reliable cash-flow generator with global scale.  
   - **LOW (6%)**: Lowe's complements Home Depot, providing exposure to the home improvement market.  
   - **SBUX (6%)**: Starbucks has a strong global presence and a loyal customer base, balancing growth and stability.  
   - **BKNG (5%)**: Booking Holdings benefits from travel recovery trends and has a robust online platform.

3. **Opportunistic Plays (Smaller Allocations - 31%)**  
   - **EBAY (3%)**: eBay offers exposure to e-commerce with a value-oriented spin.  
   - **GM (4%) and F (3%)**: General Motors and Ford provide exposure to traditional automakers transitioning to EVs.  
   - **CMG (4%)**: Chipotle's strong brand and focus on health-conscious dining support its growth potential.  
   - **ULTA (4%)**: Ulta Beauty is a leader in the beauty retail space, benefiting from strong consumer demand.  
   - **TJX (3%) and ROST (3%)**: TJX Companies and Ross Stores are off-price retailers that perform well in various economic conditions.  
   - **MAR (3%)**: Marriott benefits from long-term growth in travel and hospitality.  
   - **AZO (3%)**: AutoZone provides exposure to the auto parts market, which is resilient in downturns.

4. **Speculative and High-Risk Positions (Smaller Allocations - 11%)**  
   - **RL (2%)**: Ralph Lauren is a luxury brand with potential for growth, but it faces competition.  
   - **YUM (3%)**: Yum Brands offers exposure to fast food globally, with a focus on emerging markets.

### **Overall Portfolio Objective**
The portfolio is designed to balance high-growth opportunities (e.g., AMZN, TSLA) with steady performers (e.g., MCD, SBUX). Smaller allocations to speculative plays (e.g., CZR, RL) add an element of high-risk, high-reward potential, while diversified exposure across industries within the consumer discretionary sector reduces idiosyncratic risks. The goal is to outperform the SP500-25 consumer discretionary index by leveraging leaders in growth industries, stable cash-flow generators, and opportunistic plays.
