### Strategy/Logic Behind the Allocation:

1. **Core Focus on Market Leaders (Defensive Plays):**
   - **JNJ (10%), UNH (12%), LLY (12%)**: These are large, diversified, and stable companies with strong market positions in healthcare. They are considered "defensive" stocks that tend to perform well across market cycles. Higher weights are allocated to these stocks to provide stability and core growth.

2. **Pharmaceutical Giants with Growth Potential:**
   - **ABBV (8%), MRK (8%), PFE (5%)**: These companies have a strong pipeline of drugs and are leaders in pharmaceuticals. They are given moderate weights based on their growth potential and relatively lower volatility compared to smaller biotech firms.

3. **Innovative Biotech Companies (Growth-Oriented):**
   - **REGN (5%), VRTX (6%), MRNA (4%), BIIB (4%)**: Biotech firms are allocated smaller but meaningful weights due to their higher risk/reward profile. These companies are innovation-driven and can outperform if their drug pipelines succeed.

4. **Diversified Healthcare Providers and Payers:**
   - **CI (6%), HCA (2%)**: These companies provide healthcare services and insurance, making them less sensitive to drug approval risks. CI, being a major insurer, is given a higher weight for diversification, while HCA has a smaller allocation due to its focus on hospital operations, which are more cyclical.

5. **Medical Devices and Diagnostics:**
   - **MDT (4%), TMO (5%), ISRG (3%), SYK (3%)**: Medical device companies are allocated smaller weights to balance the portfolio. These companies benefit from long-term trends like aging populations and advancements in surgical technologies.

6. **Life Sciences and Diagnostics:**
   - **DHR (7%)**: Danaher is a leader in life sciences tools and diagnostics. It is given a higher weight due to its diversified revenue streams and strong growth potential in healthcare innovation.

7. **Risk Diversification:**
   - The portfolio is designed to balance between defensive, stable companies (e.g., JNJ, UNH) and high-growth, higher-risk companies (e.g., REGN, MRNA). This ensures that the portfolio can benefit from growth opportunities while limiting downside risk.

8. **Equal Exposure to Sub-Sectors:**
   - The portfolio ensures exposure to pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, healthcare services, and medical devices, reflecting the diversity of the healthcare sector.

9. **Overweight High-Conviction Stocks:**
   - Stocks like UNH and LLY are overweighted due to their strong historical performance, robust fundamentals, and leadership in their respective sub-sectors.

### Why This Portfolio Could Outperform:
- **Diversification:** The portfolio is well-diversified across sub-sectors, reducing idiosyncratic risk.
- **Focus on Innovation:** Allocating to biotech and medical device companies positions the portfolio to benefit from healthcare advancements.
- **Defensive Core:** Large weights to stable, dividend-paying companies like JNJ and UNH
