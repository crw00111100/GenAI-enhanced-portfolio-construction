### Underlying Strategy:
1. **Core Growth Allocation (Top 5 Stocks - 45% of Portfolio)**:
   - **NEE (12%)**: NextEra Energy is a leader in renewable energy, which is a key growth area in the utilities sector. Its strong track record of innovation and expansion into clean energy makes it a cornerstone of the portfolio.
   - **DUK (10%)** and **SO (9%)**: These are large-cap, stable utility companies with solid dividend yields and significant market share. They provide stability while offering moderate growth potential.
   - **D (8%)** and **AEP (7%)**: Both companies have strong regulated businesses and ongoing investments in renewable energy, which positions them well for future growth.

2. **Mid-Cap and Diversification Allocation (Next 10 Stocks - 48% of Portfolio)**:
   - **XEL (7%)** and **SRE (6%)**: Xcel Energy and Sempra Energy are mid-cap companies with strong renewable energy initiatives, making them attractive for growth.
   - **ED (6%)** and **EXC (5%)**: Consolidated Edison and Exelon provide stable cash flows and strong dividend yields, balancing the portfolio.
   - **CNP (5%)** and **WEC (5%)**: Both represent regional utility companies with solid fundamentals and a focus on infrastructure upgrades.
   - **AWK (4%)**: American Water Works is included for diversification into water utilities, which has a different risk-return profile compared to traditional electric utilities.
   - **AES (3%)** and **NI (3%)**: AES Corporation and NiSource add exposure to smaller, higher-growth opportunities in the sector.
   - **ETR (3%)**: Entergy provides additional exposure to regulated utilities in the southeastern U.S.

3. **Small-Cap and Niche Exposure (Final 5 Stocks - 7% of Portfolio)**:
   - **PEG (2.5%)**, **ATO (2.5%)**, **ES (2%)**, **FE (2%)**, and **CMS (2%)**: These smaller allocations are aimed at capturing niche opportunities and ensuring diversification across geographies and sub-industries within utilities.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Growth vs. Income Balance**: The portfolio tilts slightly toward growth-oriented utilities (e.g., NEE, XEL) while maintaining exposure to high-dividend-paying, stable companies (e.g., DUK, SO, ED).
- **Renewable Energy Focus**: Higher weights are given to companies with significant investments in renewable energy (e.g., NEE, XEL, SRE) to capitalize on the transition to clean energy.
- **Diversification**: Allocations are spread across large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap utilities to
