Here鈥檚 a hypothetical model allocation across the 20 tickers (weights sum to 1.00):,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
- NEE: 0.090,,,,,,,,,,
- CEG: 0.080,,,,,,,,,,
- SRE: 0.070,,,,,,,,,,
- SO: 0.070,,,,,,,,,,
- DUK: 0.070,,,,,,,,,,
- AEP: 0.060,,,,,,,,,,
- EXC: 0.060,,,,,,,,,,
- XEL: 0.050,,,,,,,,,,
- WEC: 0.050,,,,,,,,,,
- DTE: 0.045,,,,,,,,,,
- CMS: 0.045,,,,,,,,,,
- LNT: 0.040,,,,,,,,,,
- ETR: 0.040,,,,,,,,,,
- PEG: 0.035,,,,,,,,,,
- ED: 0.035,,,,,,,,,,
- AWK: 0.035,,,,,,,,,,
- ATO: 0.035,,,,,,,,,,
- CNP: 0.035,,,,,,,,,,
- NRG: 0.030,,,,,,,,,,
- AES: 0.025,,,,,,,,,,

Strategy and logic behind the weights:,,,,,,,,,,
- Quality-growth core overweight: Tilt toward utilities with multi-year capex pipelines, constructive regulatory frameworks, and decarbonization exposure that can drive above-sector EPS/CAGR and rate base growth (NEE, CEG, SRE, XEL, WEC). These names also tend to have stronger balance sheets and project backlogs.,,,,
- Stable regulated backbone: Maintain sizable, diversified exposure to large, lower-volatility regulated franchises for defensive cash flow and dividend support (SO, DUK, AEP, EXC, CMS, DTE, LNT, PEG, ETR). These provide the bulk of beta-controlled return and reduce idiosyncratic risk.
- Defensive ballast: Include steady, interest-rate-sensitive but resilient names with high-quality cash flows (AWK, ATO, ED). These help in risk-off periods and provide dividend reliability.,,,,,,,
- Opportunistic alpha sleeve: Small allocations to higher-beta independent power producers/transitional stories (NRG, AES) that can benefit from buybacks, asset optimization, or improving credit profiles; sizing is modest to cap downside.,,,,,,,
- Factor balance and risk controls: ,,,,,,,,,,
  - Barbell rate sensitivity by pairing longer-duration growth utilities (NEE, AWK) with cash-generative names (NRG, AES) to reduce pure duration risk.,,,,,,,,
  - Single-name cap kept below roughly 9% to limit concentration risk; top-10 around the low-60% range for diversification.,,,,,,,,,,
  - Aim for a mix of dividend yield, growth, and regulatory/geographic diversification across U.S. jurisdictions.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Implementation notes:,,,,,,,,,,
- Rebalance quarterly or if any position drifts more than ~30% from target weight.,,,,,,,,,,
- Monitor rate moves, credit spreads, and regulatory updates; trim/add around catalysts and valuation extremes.,,,,,,,,
- This is a hypothetical, general model and not investment advice or a guarantee of outperformance.,,,,,,,,,
