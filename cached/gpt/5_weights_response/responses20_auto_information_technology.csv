Below is a hypothetical model portfolio using only the given SP500-45 information_technology stocks. Weights are normalized to sum to 1.00 and reflect a tilt toward AI infrastructure and cybersecurity to try to outperform the sector over a cycle. This is illustrative, not investment advice.,,,,,,,,,,

- MSFT: 0.100,,,,,,,,,,,
- NVDA: 0.110,,,,,,,,,,,
- AVGO: 0.065,,,,,,,,,,,
- AAPL: 0.050,,,,,,,,,,,
- ORCL: 0.050,,,,,,,,,,,

Underlying strategy/logic,,,,,,,,,,,
- Core/platform stability (38%): MSFT, AAPL, ORCL, ADBE, CRM, NOW, INTU provide durable cash flow, wide moats, and pervasive distribution for AI features; they anchor volatility and fund rebalancing.,,,
- AI infrastructure overweight (50%): NVDA, AVGO, ANET, SNPS, CDNS, AMAT, LRCX, KLAC, AMD, plus selective QCOM/TXN exposure. These are the computational, networking, and design 鈥減icks-and-shovels鈥?of AI buildouts. The tilt seeks secular growth beyond typical semiconductor cycles.
- Cybersecurity overweight (12%): PANW and CRWD benefit from resilient security budgets and platform consolidation, aiming for growth less correlated with classic semi cycles.,,,,,,,,,,
- Concentration controls: Cap any single name at ~11% (NVDA) to avoid over-reliance on one leader while still reflecting dominance. Spread the rest by role in AI stack and quality.,,,,,,,,,,,
- Quality and growth bias: Preference for high ROIC/FCF, net cash or conservative leverage, and Rule-of-40 style software names (NOW, CRM, PANW, CRWD). Underweight more mature, slower-growth semis (QCOM, TXN).,,,,
- Diversified AI stack exposure: Balance between compute (NVDA/AMD), connectivity (ANET), custom silicon/accelerators (AVGO), chipmaking equipment (AMAT/LRCX/KLAC), and EDA IP (SNPS/CDNS) to capture value across the capex cycle.,,,,,,,
- Rebalancing approach: Periodic (e.g., quarterly) rebalance back to targets; allow mild momentum drift between rebalances to ride trends while trimming extremes.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
Why this could outperform vs. a cap-weighted sector,,,,,,,,,,,
- Emphasizes secular growth areas (AI infra and Cybersecurity) versus legacy or slower-growth segments.,,,,,,,,,,,
- Keeps a strong Core in MSFT and leading enterprise software to dampen drawdowns and compound through cycles.,,,,,,,,,,,
- Uses equipment and EDA exposure to benefit from upstream AI capex even if downstream end-markets fluctuate.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
Key risks,,,,,,,,,,,
- Elevated cyclicality and valuation risk in semis/equipment if AI capex normalizes.,,,,,,,,,,,
- Competitive/technological shifts (e.g., alternative architectures, in-house silicon).,,,,,,,,,
- Macro-driven IT spend slowdowns affecting software multiples.,,,,,,,,,,,
