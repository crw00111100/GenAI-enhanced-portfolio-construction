Below is a purely hypothetical, educational example of how one might allocate weights across the listed S&P 500 Communication Services names. This is not a recommendation or guarantee of outperformance; it鈥檚 an illustration of a possible active tilt based on quality, cash flow durability, and secular growth themes. Weights sum to 1.00.,

Strategy/logic behind the tilts,,,,
#NAME?, high-ROIC digital platforms with durable moats and strong free cash flow:,,,
  - Alphabet (GOOGL/GOOG combined exposure) and Meta (META) for search/social advertising, data advantages, and AI monetization optionality.,,
  - Netflix (NFLX) for global scale, pricing power, and margin expansion potential.,,
- Favor resilient connectivity cash flows over legacy media:,,,,
  - Broadband and converged operators (CMCSA, CHTR) and growthier wireless (TMUS) for subscription-like revenues, pricing power, and improving unit economics.,
- Selective growth in interactive entertainment:,,,,
  - TTWO and EA for IP depth, multi-year pipeline catalysts, and recurring monetization from live services/DLC.,,
- Balanced cyclical ad exposure:,,,,
  - Small weights to agencies (OMC, IPG) for ad-cycle recovery optionality without outsized risk.,,,
- Maintain modest defensives and income:,,,,
  - VZ and T included as smaller ballast/defensive yield exposures, acknowledging leverage and competitive pressures.,,,
- Underweight structurally challenged legacy media:,,,,
  - Lighter positions in WBD, PARA, FOXA, NWSA given linear-TV headwinds and heavier balance-sheet constraints.,
- Idiosyncratic/event exposure sized modestly:,,,,
  - LYV for live events/ticketing moat, DIS for IP/franchise value and parks, MTCH for niche consumer network effects.,,
,,,,
Risk notes and implementation details,,,,
- Concentration: GOOGL and GOOG are two share classes of the same company; combined they are a large single-issuer exposure. Some investors consolidate into one share class and reallocate the other鈥檚 weight elsewhere to manage concentration.,,,,
- Rebalancing: Consider quarterly/semiannual rebalances with risk guards (e.g., max 15% per issuer, max 45鈥?0% top-3 names) and review if fundamentals, leverage, or competitive dynamics change.
- Regime risk: The portfolio tilts toward quality growth and digital advertising; it may lag in value/cyclical-led markets or during ad recessions.,,,,
- This is an illustrative, non-personalized example. Actual allocations should reflect your objectives, risk tolerance, time horizon, and constraints.
