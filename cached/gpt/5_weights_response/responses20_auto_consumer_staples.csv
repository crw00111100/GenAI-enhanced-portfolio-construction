Here鈥檚 one hypothetical, normalized allocation (weights sum to 1.00) for a model portfolio built from your S&P 500 Consumer Staples list:,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
- COST: 0.10,,,,,,,,,
- WMT: 0.09,,,,,,,,,
- PG: 0.09,,,,,,,,,
- PEP: 0.085,,,,,,,,,
- KO: 0.075,,,,,,,,,
- MDLZ: 0.07,,,,,,,,,
- CL: 0.055,,,,,,,,,
- CHD: 0.04,,,,,,,,,
- KMB: 0.035,,,,,,,,,
- HSY: 0.02,,,,,,,,,
- MKC: 0.025,,,,,,,,,
- ADM: 0.03,,,,,,,,,
- MNST: 0.05,,,,,,,,,
- KDP: 0.03,,,,,,,,,
- STZ: 0.045,,,,,,,,,
- PM: 0.04,,,,,,,,,
- KR: 0.035,,,,,,,,,
- SYY: 0.035,,,,,,,,,
- GIS: 0.03,,,,,,,,,
- EL: 0.02,,,,,,,,,

Strategy/logic behind the weights,,,,,,,,,
- Quality and pricing power tilt: Overweight durable franchises with strong brands, resilient demand, and consistent free cash flow (COST, WMT, PG, PEP, KO, MDLZ, CL). These names historically pass through inflation and defend margins, aiming to outperform over a cycle.
- Growth satellites: Add a Growth bias via MNST, STZ, CHD, and KDP鈥攏ames with higher organic growth and margin expansion potential鈥攚hile keeping position sizes below core holdings to manage volatility.,,,,,,
- Defensive income and diversification: Include PM for yield/defensiveness and diversification of demand drivers; balance retail (COST/WMT/KR) with beverages, household/personal care, and food producers to reduce single-factor risk.,,,,,,,
- Select underweights where fundamentals/inputs are headwinds: Smaller weights to HSY and MKC due to input-cost sensitivity and category elasticity; modest ADM and SYY exposure for cyclical ag/foodservice dynamics without dominating risk.,,,,,,,,,
- Risk controls: Cap single-name exposure near 10%, maintain broad subsector balance, and avoid excessive concentration in slow-growth, high-input-cost names. Rebalance periodically to keep factor tilts (quality, profitability, moderate growth) while trimming valuations that stretch too far.,,,,
