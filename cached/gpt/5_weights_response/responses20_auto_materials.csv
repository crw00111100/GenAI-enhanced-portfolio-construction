Strategy/logic behind the weights:,,,,,
- Quality core (overweight): Tilt to durable, high-ROIC, pricing-power names expected to compound through cycles: industrial gases (LIN, APD) and coatings/consumables (SHW, ECL, PPG). These are given the largest combined allocation to anchor risk and drive steady alpha vs. a cap-weighted sector.
- Infrastructure and construction cycle: Meaningful weights to aggregates (MLM, VMC) to capture multi-year US infrastructure and housing repair demand with relatively resilient margins.,,,,
- Secular/thematic growth: Moderate weights to agriculture tech (CTVA) for seed traits and CP exposure; lithium (ALB) for EV/energy storage optionality, sized conservatively due to volatility; DD as a diversified specialty materials recovery play.,,,,
- Cyclical torque, but capped: Exposure to copper (FCX) for electrification demand; steel (NUE, STLD) for US onshoring/infrastructure; petrochemicals (LYB, DOW) and fertilizers (CF, MOS) for commodity-cycle upside. Each is sized to add beta without dominating drawdowns.,
- Defensive ballast and cash-flow steadiness: Packaging (PKG, BALL) and gold exposure (NEM) to dampen cyclicality and provide a hedge against inflation/market stress.,,,,
- Risk controls: Single-name caps near ~9% and balanced sleeve sizing (quality core > infrastructure > cyclicals > defensives). The mix aims for a quality/profitability tilt with selective cyclical leverage to potentially outperform a cap-weighted materials basket across a cycle, while maintaining diversification.,,,,
