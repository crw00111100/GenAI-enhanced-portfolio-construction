Below is a purely hypothetical model allocation across the 20 tickers, normalized to 1.00. It overweights structural growth (data centers, towers, logistics) and inflation-capturing residential, while underweighting more cyclical retail/hotel exposures.,,,,

Underlying strategy and logic,,,,,,,,
- Overweight secular growth infrastructure (~43.5%): Data centers (EQIX, DLR), towers (AMT, CCI), and logistics (PLD). These have durable demand drivers (cloud/AI, mobile data, e鈥慶ommerce/nearshoring), high operating leverage, and strong balance sheets.
- Inflation-capture barbell in housing (~24%): Mix short-duration residential/SFR (AVB, EQR, ESS, MAA, UDR, INVH) to reprice rents quickly with structural growth sleeves above. INVH slightly overweight for single鈥慺amily rental tailwinds and operating margin resilience.,,,
- Defensive, long-duration cash flows (~19.5% combined): Net lease/gaming (O, VICI) and healthcare seniors housing/medical (WELL, VTR). Preference to VICI and WELL for better embedded growth/CPI linkages and external growth visibility; O sized for stability/diversification.,,,,,
- Underweight cyclical retail/hotel (~9%): Lower allocations to malls/open鈥慳ir (SPG, REG, KIM) and hotels (HST) given higher economic sensitivity and operating volatility; still included for diversification and potential mean reversion.,,,,,,
- Real assets/inflation hedge (WY ~4%): Timber provides optionality to housing cycles and long-term land value, offering a differentiated real asset profile within the sleeve.,,,,,,,
- Quality and balance-sheet bias: Tilt toward names with investment-grade balance sheets, longer debt maturities, and access to low-cost capital to fund accretive development/redevelopment.,,,,,,
- Valuation and growth overlay: Within each sleeve, weightings reflect a blend of expected multi-year AFFO/NOI growth, internal rent roll-up (mark-to-market), development pipelines, and relative valuation (FFO multiples/NAV gaps).,,,,
- Risk controls: Position-size caps near ~11% per name, diversified across subindustries, and a bias to liquid, large-cap leaders. Expect higher tracking error vs. the sector benchmark but with a goal of improved multi-year risk-adjusted returns.,,,,,

Notes,,,,,,,,
- This is an illustrative example for discussion and education, not advice. Outperformance is not guaranteed and depends on macro (rates/inflation), capital markets, and company execution.,,,,,
- Rebalance cadence could be quarterly or upon material Valuation/estimate changes while maintaining the sleeve targets described above.,,,,,,,,
