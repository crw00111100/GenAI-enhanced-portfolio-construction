Below is a hypothetical model portfolio for the given S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary tickers. Weights are normalized to sum to 1.00.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Proposed weights,,,,,,,,,,
- AMZN: 0.10,,,,,,,,,,
- TSLA: 0.05,,,,,,,,,,
- HD: 0.055,,,,,,,,,,
- LOW: 0.045,,,,,,,,,,
- MCD: 0.05,,,,,,,,,,
- NKE: 0.035,,,,,,,,,,
- LULU: 0.04,,,,,,,,,,
- TJX: 0.07,,,,,,,,,,
- ROST: 0.045,,,,,,,,,,
- ULTA: 0.035,,,,,,,,,,
- ORLY: 0.075,,,,,,,,,,
- AZO: 0.065,,,,,,,,,,
- BKNG: 0.07,,,,,,,,,,
- MAR: 0.03,,,,,,,,,,
- HLT: 0.03,,,,,,,,,,
- CMG: 0.065,,,,,,,,,,
- SBUX: 0.04,,,,,,,,,,
- DPZ: 0.03,,,,,,,,,,
- DHI: 0.035,,,,,,,,,,
- LEN: 0.035,,,,,,,,,,

Underlying strategy and logic,,,,,,,,,,
- Quality and resilience tilt,,,,,,,,,,
  - Overweights to high-ROIC, cash-generative, asset-light and/or defensive category leaders (TJX, ROST, ORLY, AZO, BKNG, CMG, MCD). These names have historically offered strong unit economics, pricing power, and lower earnings volatility within a cyclical sector.
- Secular growth exposure,,,,,,,,,,
  - AMZN receives a top allocation for its scaled platforms and multiple growth vectors.,,,,,,,,,,
  - LULU, CMG, and BKNG are overweight as secular compounders with strong brand equity and runway.,,,,,,,,
- Cyclical balance,,,,,,,,,,
  - Off-price retailers (TJX, ROST) and auto parts retailers (ORLY, AZO) can be relatively resilient in slowdowns, helping balance more cyclical travel, home improvement, and homebuilders.,,,,,
  - Home improvement (HD, LOW) sized mid-weight for structural demand from aging housing stock, but kept below top weights due to rate sensitivity.,,,,,,,,
  - Homebuilders (DHI, LEN) included at modest weights to capture potential housing undersupply tailwinds while managing cyclicality.,,,,,,,,,
- Selective underweights vs. headline-heavy names,,,,,,,,,,
  - TSLA held but not oversized to limit single-name and valuation/volatility risk.,,,,,,,,,,
  - NKE and ULTA included but at moderate weights given fashion/category cycles and margin sensitivity.,,,,,,,,,,
- Diversification across subsectors,,,,,,,,,,
  - Balanced exposure across e-commerce, auto-related, restaurants, apparel/beauty, travel/hospitality, home-related, and QSR/fast-casual.,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Risk management and implementation notes,,,,,,,,,,
- Position caps and subsector balance: No single name above 10%; multiple subsectors represented to reduce idiosyncratic drawdowns.,,,,,,,,,,
- Rebalancing cadence: Quarterly, with reviews of factor signals (profitability/ROIC, margin stability, revenue durability, price momentum, and valuation discipline).,,,,,
- Dynamic tilts: Increase defensives (off-price, auto parts retail, QSR) when macro risk rises; lean into secular growth when risk appetite improves.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
This allocation is an illustrative example only and not investment advice. It aims to tilt toward quality and durable growth within Consumer Discretionary to potentially outperform a broad sector index over a cycle while maintaining diversification.,,,,,,,,,,
