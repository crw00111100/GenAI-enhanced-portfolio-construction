Here鈥檚 a hypothetical, normalized allocation across the 20 stocks (weights sum to 1.000):,,,,,
,,,,,,
- ETN: 0.085,,,,,,
- PH: 0.065,,,,,,
- ROK: 0.060,,,,,,
- ITW: 0.045,,,,,,
- PWR: 0.065,,,,,,
- TT: 0.060,,,,,,
- CARR: 0.035,,,,,,
- WM: 0.045,,,,,,
- UNP: 0.045,,,,,,
- UPS: 0.035,,,,,,
- GWW: 0.050,,,,,,
- DE: 0.035,,,,,,
- CAT: 0.035,,,,,,
- EMR: 0.030,,,,,,
- LMT: 0.045,,,,,,
- NOC: 0.040,,,,,,
- RTX: 0.040,,,,,,
- TDG: 0.065,,,,,,
- HWM: 0.040,,,,,,
- GE: 0.080,,,,,,
- Total: 1.000,,,,,,

Strategy/logic behind the weights,,,,,,
- Tilt to secular growth and quality to seek excess returns over a cap鈥憌eighted industrials basket:,,,,,,
  - Electrification and grid/efficiency: ETN, PWR, PH, ROK, TT, CARR,
  - Aerospace content and aftermarket (high pricing power/recurring revenue): TDG, HWM, GE; balanced with primes LMT, NOC, RTX,,
  - Durable moats/distribution: GWW,,,,,,
  - Defensive, non-cyclical cash flows: WM,,,,,
- Underweight more economically sensitive heavy equipment and freight: lower weights to DE, CAT, UPS; maintain modest rail exposure via UNP for diversification.,,,,
- quality and profitability bias: prioritize firms with high ROIC, margin resilience, and services/aftermarket mix (ITW, ROK, TDG, GWW, ETN).
- Risk controls embedded in sizing:,,,,,,
  - Per-name cap ~8.5% to avoid concentration risk.,,,,,,
  - Subsector balance: electrification/automation ~46%, aerospace/defense ~31%, logistics/transport ~8%, machinery ~7%, waste ~4.5%, diversified industrial ~3%.,
  - Blend cyclical exposure with defensives to dampen drawdowns.,,,,,,
- Rebalancing approach: review quarterly or on 卤1.5鈥?.0% absolute drift per position; trim/add based on relative fundamentals/momentum while maintaining the core tilts.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
This is a hypothetical example for illustration only; it鈥檚 not a recommendation.,,,,,,
