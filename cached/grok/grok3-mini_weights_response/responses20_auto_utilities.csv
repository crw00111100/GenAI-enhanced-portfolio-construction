Below is a hypothetical example of how I, as a helpful assistant, might allocate weights to the 20 utilities stocks you provided from the SP500-55 utilities index (noting that the list contains 20 stocks, not 55â€”I'll assume this is the subset you're referring to). The weights are normalized to sum to 1.00, as requested. My goal in this allocation is to potentially outperform the SP500-55 utilities index by using a factor-based strategy that deviates from a simple market-cap or equal-weight approach.

### Hypothetical Weight Allocation
Here's the proposed weight distribution for the portfolio:

| Stock Ticker | Hypothetical Weight |
|--------------|--------------------|
| NEE         | 0.10 (10.0%)       |
| DUK         | 0.08 (8.0%)        |
| SO          | 0.08 (8.0%)        |
| AEP         | 0.07 (7.0%)        |
| EXC         | 0.06 (6.0%)        |
| D           | 0.05 (5.0%)        |
| XEL         | 0.05 (5.0%)        |
| WEC         | 0.05 (5.0%)        |
| ED          | 0.06 (6.0%)        |
| PEG         | 0.05 (5.0%)        |
| AEE         | 0.04 (4.0%)        |
| FE          | 0.04 (4.0%)        |
| CMS         | 0.04 (4.0%)        |
| LNT         | 0.04 (4.0%)        |
| NI          | 0.04 (4.0%)        |
| CNP         | 0.03 (3.0%)        |
| ETR         | 0.03 (3.0%)        |
| PCG         | 0.03 (3.0%)        |
| EIX         | 0.03 (3.0%)        |
| ES          | 0.03 (3.0%)        |

- **Total Sum of Weights**: 1.00 (100%), as verified.

### Underlying Strategy and Logic
The allocation is based on a **hypothetical factor-based strategy** designed to potentially outperform the SP500-55 utilities index by emphasizing stability, income generation, and risk management. Utilities stocks are typically defensive, with lower volatility and reliable dividends, but outperforming an index requires tilting the portfolio toward factors that could capture excess returns. Here's the logic I used:

1. **Core Strategy: Factor Tilt Toward Dividend Yield and Volatility**:
   - I used a combination of two key factors: **dividend yield** (to favor income-generating stocks) and **volatility (beta)** (to underweight higher-risk stocks). This is inspired by value and low-volatility investing strategies, which have historically shown potential to outperform in certain market conditions, such as during periods of economic uncertainty or market downturns.
   - **Dividend Yield Tilt**: Stocks with historically higher dividend yields (e.g., DUK, SO, ED) were overweighted because they can provide steady income, which may compound returns over time through reinvestment. In a utilities sector, high-dividend stocks often correlate with stability and lower risk.
   - **Volatility (Beta) Tilt**: Stocks with lower historical volatility (e.g., NEE, despite its growth focus, is assumed to have moderate beta due to its renewable energy stability) were favored, while higher-volatility stocks (e.g., PCG, EIX, which might be more sensitive to regulatory or market changes) were underweighted to reduce overall portfolio risk. This aims to achieve a better risk-adjusted return compared to the index, which might be more heavily weighted toward larger, but potentially more volatile, companies.

2. **Weight Assignment Process**:
   - I started with a base of equal weighting (5% per stock, since there are 20 stocks) and then applied adjustments based on hypothetical factor scores.
   - **Hypothetical Factor Scoring**: I assumed a simple score for each stock based on publicly available historical data (e.g., from sources like Yahoo Finance or Bloomberg). For instance:
     - High scores for dividend yield and low volatility led to weights of 6-10% (e.g., NEE is overweighted for its growth potential in renewables, which could drive long-term outperformance).
     - Medium scores resulted in weights around 4-5%.
     - Low scores (e.g., higher volatility or lower dividends) led to weights of 3%.
   - The weights were then normalized to ensure they sum to 1.00. This creates a diversified portfolio while deviating from the index's likely market-cap weighting, which might overweight larger stocks without considering income or risk factors.

3. **Rationale for Outperformance Potential**:
   - **Why This Might Outperform**: By tilting toward high-dividend and low-volatility stocks, the portfolio could generate consistent income and exhibit lower drawdowns during market volatility, potentially leading to better compounded returns over time. For example, in a rising interest rate environment, high-dividend utilities might attract more investors, while low-volatility holdings could provide downside protection. This contrasts with a passive index approach, which might not actively select for these factors.
   - **Risks and Limitations**: This is purely hypothetical and based on assumed data. In reality, actual performance would depend on market conditions, and factors like dividend yield or volatility can change. Additionally, this strategy might underperform in a high-growth scenario where volatile stocks rally strongly. As an assistant, I recommend consulting a financial advisor for real-world applications, as past performance is not indicative of future results.
