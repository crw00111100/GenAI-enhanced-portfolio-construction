**Total Weight: 100% (1.00)**

### Underlying Strategy and Logic for Weight Allocation
The goal of this portfolio is to potentially outperform the S&P 500-30 Consumer Staples Index by focusing on a combination of **defensive stability**, **growth potential**, and **diversification** within the sector. The consumer staples sector is generally considered a defensive sector, performing relatively well during economic downturns due to the consistent demand for essential goods. However, not all companies within the sector have the same growth prospects or risk profiles. The following principles guided the allocation:

1. **Focus on Market Leaders with Strong Fundamentals (Higher Weights)**:
   - Companies like **Procter & Gamble (PG)**, **Coca-Cola (KO)**, **PepsiCo (PEP)**, **Walmart (WMT)**, and **Costco (COST)** are given higher weights (7.5%-10.0%) because they are industry leaders with strong brand recognition, consistent revenue streams, and global market presence. These companies often have stable earnings, strong balance sheets, and a history of dividend payments, making them core holdings for stability and income.
   - These larger weights reflect confidence in their ability to weather economic cycles and contribute to portfolio stability while still offering moderate growth.

2. **Mid-Tier Weights for Established but Smaller Players**:
   - Stocks like **Colgate-Palmolive (CL)**, **Kimberly-Clark (KMB)**, **General Mills (GIS)**, and **Mondelez (MDLZ)** are assigned mid-tier weights (4.5%-6.0%). These companies are well-established in their niches (personal care, packaged foods, snacks) and provide diversification within the consumer staples sector. They may not have the same scale as the top-tier companies but still offer reliable performance and dividend yields.

3. **Growth and Niche Opportunities (Moderate Weights)**:
   - Companies such as **Church & Dwight (CHD)** and **McCormick & Company (MKC)** receive moderate weights (2.5%-3.0%) due to their exposure to growing niches (household products, spices, and flavorings). These firms have shown innovation and adaptability, which could drive above-average growth within the sector.
   - **Costco (COST)** also falls into this growth-oriented logic due to its membership-based model and strong e-commerce growth, justifying a higher weight compared to other retailers.

4. **Lower Weights for Higher Risk or Underperforming Stocks**:
   - Stocks like **Kraft Heinz (KHC)** and **Estée Lauder (EL)** are given lower weights (1.5%) due to specific challenges. Kraft Heinz has faced issues with debt and declining brand relevance, while Estée Lauder, though a strong player in beauty, is more cyclical compared to other consumer staples (less "essential" during downturns). These lower weights reduce exposure to potential underperformance.
   - Similarly, **Tyson Foods (TSN)** and **J.M. Smucker (SJM)** receive smaller allocations (2.0%) due to volatility in commodity prices (for Tyson) and limited growth prospects (for Smucker).

5. **Diversification Across Sub-Sectors**:
   - The portfolio balances exposure across sub-sectors within consumer staples, such as food and beverage (KO, PEP, GIS, KHC), household and personal care (PG, CL, KMB, CHD), retail (WMT, COST), and packaged goods (MDLZ, K). This diversification helps mitigate risks associated with any single sub-sector underperforming due to specific headwinds (e.g., rising input costs for food producers).

6. **Tilt Toward Defensive Growth Over Pure Value**:
   - While the S&P 500-30 Consumer Staples Index might weight stocks based on market capitalization, this portfolio slightly overweights companies with better growth prospects (e.g., COST, CHD) and underweights those with stagnant growth or high debt (e.g., KHC). This tilt aims to capture upside potential while maintaining the defensive nature of the sector.

### How This Portfolio Aims to Outperform the Index
- **Active Weighting vs. Market-Cap Weighting**: Unlike a passive index fund that allocates based on market capitalization, this portfolio actively overweights companies with stronger growth potential and stability while underweighting laggards. This could lead to outperformance if the selected overweighted stocks grow faster than the broader index.
- **Focus on Quality and Growth**: By prioritizing companies with strong fundamentals and exposure to growing consumer trends (e.g., e-commerce for Costco, health-focused products for Church & Dwight), the portfolio aims to achieve higher returns than the index average.
- **Risk Mitigation**: The diversified allocation across sub-sectors and the emphasis on stable, dividend-paying companies reduce downside risk compared to a more concentrated portfolio, while still allowing for some growth-oriented bets.

### Caveats
- This is a hypothetical allocation and does not account for real-time market conditions, stock valuations, or specific financial data (e.g., P/E ratios, dividend yields, or debt levels). In a real-world scenario, these factors would be analyzed in detail before assigning weights.
- Past performance and sector trends are not guarantees of future results. The consumer staples sector can be affected by macroeconomic factors like inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending patterns.
- Transaction costs, taxes, and rebalancing frequency are not considered in this theoretical model.

This allocation serves as an example of how a portfolio manager might approach constructing a consumer staples portfolio with the goal of outperforming the benchmark index through a mix of stability, growth, and diversification. If you have specific goals (e.g., income focus, ESG considerations), the weights and logic can be adjusted accordingly.
