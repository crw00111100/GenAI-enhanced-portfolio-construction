Below is a hypothetical allocation of weights to the 20 consumer discretionary stocks from the S&P 500-25 list provided. The weights are normalized to sum to 1.00 (100%). Following the allocation, I will explain the underlying strategy and logic used to assign these weights with the goal of potentially outperforming the S&P 500-25 Consumer Discretionary Index.

**Total Weight: 1.00 (100%)**

### Underlying Strategy and Logic
The allocation of weights in this hypothetical portfolio is based on a combination of **growth potential**, **market leadership**, **sector diversification**, and **risk-adjusted returns**. The goal is to outperform the S&P 500-25 Consumer Discretionary Index by overweighting stocks with strong growth prospects and underweighting those with higher volatility or limited upside potential. Here's the detailed reasoning behind the strategy:

1. **Focus on Market Leaders and Growth Stocks**:
   - Stocks like **AMZN (Amazon)** and **TSLA (Tesla)** are given the highest weights (15% and 12%, respectively) due to their dominant positions in e-commerce and electric vehicles, respectively. Both companies have demonstrated consistent innovation, strong revenue growth, and significant market share in their respective industries.
   - **NKE (NIKE)** and **HD (Home Depot)** are also overweighted (8% each) as they are leaders in apparel/athleisure and home improvement, sectors with stable demand and strong brand loyalty.

2. **Balance with Defensive and Stable Stocks**:
   - **MCD (McDonald's)** and **SBUX (Starbucks)** receive moderate weights (7% and 6%, respectively) due to their defensive nature within the consumer discretionary sector. These companies tend to perform well even during economic downturns, as they cater to everyday consumer needs (fast food and coffee).
   - This helps balance the portfolio by reducing overall volatility while still maintaining exposure to consumer discretionary trends.

3. **Diversification Across Sub-Sectors**:
   - The portfolio includes exposure to various sub-sectors within consumer discretionary, such as retail (AMZN, TJX, ROST), automotive (TSLA, GM, F), restaurants (MCD, SBUX, CMG, DPZ, DRI, YUM), home improvement (HD, LOW), apparel (NKE, LULU, ULTA), travel (BKNG), and auto parts (AZO, ORLY).
   - Weights are distributed to avoid over-concentration in any single sub-sector, reducing idiosyncratic risk. For instance, smaller weights (2-3%) are assigned to smaller or more niche players like DPZ, ULTA, and AZO.

4. **Risk-Adjusted Growth Potential**:
   - High-growth but volatile stocks like **CMG (Chipotle)** and **LULU (Lululemon)** are assigned smaller weights (3% each) to capture upside potential while limiting downside risk due to their higher valuations and sensitivity to consumer spending trends.
   - Similarly, automotive stocks like **GM** and **F** receive moderate to low weights (4% and 3%, respectively) due to cyclical risks in the auto industry, despite their potential for growth in electric vehicles.

5. **Underweighting Lower Growth or High-Risk Stocks**:
   - Stocks like **DRI (Darden Restaurants)**, **YUM (Yum! Brands)**, **AZO (AutoZone)**, and **ORLY (O'Reilly Automotive)** are given smaller weights (2% each) because they operate in mature or highly competitive markets with limited growth catalysts compared to other stocks in the portfolio.
   - This allows the portfolio to focus capital on higher-growth opportunities while still maintaining broad exposure.

6. **Benchmark Outperformance Goal**:
   - The S&P 500-25 Consumer Discretionary Index is typically market-cap weighted, meaning larger companies like AMZN and TSLA already have significant influence. This portfolio slightly overweights these leaders while strategically allocating more to mid-tier growth stocks (e.g., NKE, MCD) compared to a pure market-cap approach, aiming to capture alpha through active selection.
   - The portfolio also avoids overexposure to highly cyclical or underperforming sub-sectors (e.g., traditional automotive or mature retail) that may drag down index performance.

### Additional Notes
- This allocation assumes a long-term investment horizon (e.g., 3-5 years) and is designed to capture growth in consumer discretionary trends such as e-commerce, sustainable mobility (electric vehicles), and experiential spending (restaurants, travel).
- The weights are hypothetical and do not account for real-time market conditions, earnings reports, or macroeconomic factors like interest rates or consumer sentiment, which would need to be considered in a real-world scenario.
- Regular rebalancing (e.g., quarterly) would be recommended to adjust weights based on performance, valuation changes, and evolving market trends.

This strategy aims to outperform the S&P 500-25 Consumer Discretionary Index by focusing on a blend of high-growth leaders, stable performers, and diversified exposure while managing risk through thoughtful weight distribution.
