Of course. Here is a hypothetical model portfolio constructed from the 20 S&P 500 industrial stocks provided. This portfolio is designed with a specific strategy aimed at potentially outperforming a market-cap-weighted index of the same stocks.

### **Portfolio Strategy: Thematic Growth & Quality Focus**

The underlying logic for this portfolio is to move away from a simple market-cap weighting and instead overweight companies based on two key factors:

1.  **Alignment with Long-Term Secular Growth Themes:** The portfolio is tilted towards companies best positioned to benefit from major, multi-year trends such as infrastructure spending, reshoring of manufacturing, sustainability/decarbonization, and automation/digitalization.
2.  **Business Quality and Stability:** A significant portion of the portfolio is anchored in high-quality, wide-moat companies that exhibit strong balance sheets, consistent cash flow, and market leadership. This "quality" factor is intended to provide stability and downside protection.

This approach creates a "core and satellite" structure within the portfolio. The **Core** consists of stable, high-quality leaders, while the **Satellites** are targeted, thematic bets on higher-growth areas.

### **Key Thematic Tilts:**

*   **Infrastructure & Reshoring:** Overweighting machinery and electrical equipment companies (e.g., CAT, ETN) that are direct beneficiaries of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the trend of bringing manufacturing back to North America.
*   **Sustainability & Efficiency:** Increasing allocation to companies that provide solutions for energy efficiency, building automation, and the circular economy (e.g., JCI, WM, CARR).
*   **Automation & Digitalization:** Favoring companies at the forefront of the "factory of the future" and industrial software (e.g., ROK, HON).
*   **Defense Modernization:** Maintaining a strong position in prime defense contractors benefiting from geopolitical instability and increased defense budgets (e.g., LMT, RTX).

### **Hypothetical Portfolio Allocation**

Here is the hypothetical weight distribution for the 20 stocks, normalized to 100%.

| Ticker | Company Name | Weight (%) | Rationale for Weighting |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HON** | Honeywell International Inc. | 9.0% | **Core Holding.** Highly diversified, strong balance sheet, and a leader in key growth areas like automation, aerospace, and sustainable building tech. |
| **UNP** | Union Pacific Corporation | 8.0% | **Core Holding.** A rail duopoly with significant pricing power, essential for the North American supply chain and a key beneficiary of reshoring. |
| **LMT** | Lockheed Martin Corporation | 7.5% | **Thematic Overweight (Defense).** The premier global defense contractor with flagship programs (F-35) ensuring long-term revenue visibility. |
| **CAT** | Caterpillar Inc. | 7.0% | **Thematic Overweight (Infrastructure).** The quintessential play on global infrastructure, construction, and mining activity. |
| **UPS** | United Parcel Service, Inc. | 7.0% | **Core Holding.** A global logistics leader with a powerful network. Essential to e-commerce and global trade, providing stability. |
| **ETN** | Eaton Corporation plc | 6.5% | **Thematic Overweight (Electrification).** A prime beneficiary of the global electrification trend, from EVs to data centers and grid modernization. |
| **JCI** | Johnson Controls International | 6.0% | **Thematic Overweight (Sustainability).** Leader in smart, healthy, and sustainable building solutions, directly playing into the decarbonization trend. |
| **WM** | Waste Management, Inc. | 5.5% | **Core Holding.** A non-cyclical, essential service with strong pricing power and growing investments in renewable energy and the circular economy. |
| **RTX** | RTX Corporation (Raytheon) | 5.0% | **Market Weight.** A balanced exposure to both commercial aerospace recovery and high-tech defense systems. |
| **DE** | Deere & Company | 5.0% | **Market Weight.** A high-quality leader in precision agriculture, but its cyclicality is balanced against other holdings. |
| **ROK** | Rockwell Automation, Inc. | 4.5% | **Thematic Overweight (Automation).** A pure-play on industrial automation and smart manufacturing, a key long-term growth driver. |
| **ITW** | Illinois Tool Works Inc. | 4.0% | **Market Weight.** A high-quality, well-managed conglomerate with a unique decentralized business model, providing diversification. |
| **CSX** | CSX Corporation | 3.5% | **Market Weight.** The second major US railroad, providing exposure to Eastern US logistics and intermodal transport. Weighted slightly less than UNP. |
| **RSG** | Republic Services, Inc. | 3.0% | **Market Weight.** The #2 player in waste management, offering similar stability to WM but with a slightly smaller allocation for concentration reasons. |
| **GD** | General Dynamics Corporation | 3.0% | **Underweight.** A solid defense contractor, but weighted less than LMT and RTX to focus on higher-growth aerospace and tech-focused defense. |
| **CARR** | Carrier Global Corporation | 3.0% | **Market Weight.** A solid HVAC company benefiting from the electrification and efficiency upgrade cycle. |
| **PH** | Parker-Hannifin Corporation | 2.5% | **Underweight.** A high-quality but broadly cyclical motion and control technologies company. Underweighted to fund thematic bets. |
| **CMI** | Cummins Inc. | 2.0% | **Underweight.** A leader in engine technology, but faces long-term disruption from the transition to electric vehicles. Its "New Power" segment is promising but still small. |
| **OTIS**| Otis Worldwide Corporation | 2.0% | **Underweight.** A stable business with a strong service portfolio, but perceived as having lower growth potential compared to other building tech plays. |
| **EMR** | Emerson Electric Co. | 2.0% | **Underweight.** A quality company in the midst of a portfolio transformation. Underweighted pending clearer execution on its focused automation strategy. |
| **Total** | | **100.0%** | |
