Of course. Here is a hypothetical model portfolio constructed from the provided list of 20 consumer staples stocks. This portfolio is designed with a specific strategy aimed at potentially outperforming a market-cap-weighted index of the same stocks.

### **Hypothetical Portfolio: "Quality & Growth" Consumer Staples Fund**

This theoretical fund is built on a "Core-Satellite" approach with a tilt towards companies demonstrating superior brand strength, pricing power, and identifiable growth catalysts.

### **Underlying Strategy and Logic**

The goal of this portfolio is to outperform a passive, market-cap-weighted consumer staples index. A passive index often over-weights large, slower-growing legacy companies and may be exposed to industries with secular headwinds (like tobacco). This active strategy makes deliberate bets based on a **"Core-Satellite" framework with a "Quality & Growth" tilt.**

The portfolio is divided into four conceptual tiers:

**1. Core Holdings (45% of Portfolio)**
*   **Stocks:** `COST, PG, PEP, MDLZ, KO`
*   **Logic:** This forms the foundation of the portfolio. These companies are global leaders with fortress-like balance sheets, immense brand equity, and significant pricing power. They are "overweighted" relative to many peers because they have demonstrated an ability to consistently grow revenue and earnings even in tough economic environments. They provide stability and predictable cash flow.

**2. Growth-Tilted Satellites (30% of Portfolio)**
*   **Stocks:** `MNST, WMT, STZ, EL, HSY`
*   **Logic:** This is the engine intended to drive outperformance. Each stock is chosen for a specific growth catalyst that differentiates it from the broader, more mature staples sector.
    *   **MNST:** Pure-play on the high-growth energy drink category.
    *   **WMT:** A value retailer transforming into an e-commerce and logistics powerhouse.
    *   **STZ & EL:** Bets on "premiumization," where consumers are willing to pay more for higher-quality alcohol and luxury cosmetics.
    *   **HSY:** Dominance in a category (confectionery) that has proven resilient and has pricing power.

**3. Stable Value Holdings (10.5% of Portfolio)**
*   **Stocks:** `MKC, SYY, CL`
*   **Logic:** These are classic, defensive staples that provide diversification. They are included for their stability but are weighted less than the Core and Growth tiers because their overall growth prospects are considered more modest. They are solid companies but are not expected to be the primary drivers of outperformance.

**4. Significant Underweights & Exclusions (14.5% of Portfolio)**
*   **Stocks:** `KR, CLX, GIS, KMB, PM, MO` (and `CHD` excluded)
*   **Logic:** This is where the active management is most apparent. To overweight the companies we have high conviction in, we must underweight or exclude others.
    *   **Tobacco (`PM`, `MO`):** While they offer high dividend yields, they face undeniable long-term secular decline, regulatory risks, and are often excluded from ESG-focused funds. Their weight is kept minimal.
    *   **Intense Competition (`KR`, `KMB`, `GIS`, `CLX`):** These companies operate in highly competitive fields with lower margins (groceries) or face significant pressure from private-label brands and shifting consumer tastes. Their growth path is considered more challenging than the Core and Growth holdings.
    *   **Exclusion (`CHD`):** In a concentrated portfolio, not every stock can be included. To amplify the weights in higher-conviction names, some good companies must be excluded.

By concentrating capital in companies with strong brands and clear growth paths while reducing exposure to those with secular or competitive headwinds, this hypothetical portfolio aims to generate alpha over its benchmark index.
