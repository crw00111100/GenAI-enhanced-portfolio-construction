Of course. Here is a hypothetical model portfolio constructed from the provided list of 20 healthcare stocks. This portfolio is designed with a specific strategy aimed at potentially outperforming a standard market-cap-weighted index like the SP500-35 Health Care sector.

**Disclaimer:** This is a theoretical and educational example, not financial advice. The weights and strategy are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect a recommendation to buy or sell any securities. Real-world portfolio construction requires in-depth research, risk tolerance assessment, and consideration of market conditions.

### **Underlying Strategy: "Core-Satellite with a Growth Tilt"**

To outperform an index, a portfolio must be different from it. A standard index is market-cap weighted, meaning the largest companies (like UNH and JNJ) dominate. Our strategy will intentionally deviate from this by using a **Core-Satellite** approach.

*   **The Core (approx. 55% of the portfolio):** This section is the foundation, composed of large, stable, blue-chip companies with strong cash flows, established market positions, and often, reliable dividends. They provide stability and defensiveness. We will hold these companies but may underweight them relative to the market-cap index to free up capital for growth opportunities.

*   **The Satellites (approx. 45% of the portfolio):** This is where we seek to generate outperformance (alpha). This portion is further divided into two segments:
    1.  **Secular Growth & Innovation (30%):** These are companies that are leaders in high-growth sub-sectors like medical devices, life sciences tools, and revolutionary treatments (e.g., GLP-1 drugs, continuous glucose monitoring). We will significantly overweight these names compared to the index.
    2.  **Speculative & Pipeline-Driven (15%):** This is our high-risk, high-reward allocation. It includes companies with volatile stocks but potentially transformative technology platforms or drug pipelines. The weights here are kept smaller to manage risk.

This structure provides a balance between the stability of the healthcare sector's giants and the dynamic growth potential of its innovators.

### **Key Deviations from a Market-Cap Index:**

1.  **Overweight Eli Lilly (LLY):** This is the portfolio's biggest bet. The strategy assumes the growth from its diabetes and obesity drugs will drive significant outperformance, justifying a top allocation that is likely much higher than its current index weight.
2.  **Underweight Johnson & Johnson (JNJ):** While a fantastic company, its massive size can make market-beating growth difficult. We reduce its weight to fund more dynamic companies like LLY, ISRG, and DXCM.
3.  **Focus on MedTech and Tools:** The portfolio has significant exposure to medical device and life science tool companies (ISRG, EW, DXCM, TMO, DHR), which benefit from long-term secular trends like aging populations and increased R&D spending.
4.  **Controlled Speculative Exposure:** By allocating a small, explicit weight to higher-risk names like MRNA and GILD, the portfolio can capture potential upside from clinical trial success or technological breakthroughs without jeopardizing the entire fund's stability.
