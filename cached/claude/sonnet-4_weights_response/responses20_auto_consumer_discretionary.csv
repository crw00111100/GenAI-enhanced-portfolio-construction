## Portfolio Allocation

**Large Cap Growth Leaders (45%)**
- AMZN: 15%
- TSLA: 12%
- HD: 10%
- NKE: 8%

**Defensive Consumer Plays (20%)**
- MCD: 8%
- SBUX: 7%
- LOW: 5%

**High-Growth/Premium Brands (15%)**
- LULU: 6%
- ULTA: 5%
- CMG: 4%

**Value/Recovery Plays (12%)**
- F: 4%
- GM: 4%
- BBY: 4%

**Specialty/Niche Players (8%)**
- TJX: 3%
- ORLY: 2.5%
- AZO: 2.5%

**Total: 100%**

*Note: Excluded BKNG, RCL, YUM, ABNB due to portfolio concentration limits*

## Strategy & Logic

**1. Quality Growth Overweight (45%)**
- Heavy allocation to proven market leaders with strong moats
- AMZN: Dominant e-commerce/cloud platform with multiple growth vectors
- TSLA: EV market leadership with energy storage upside
- HD/NKE: Strong brand equity and consistent execution

**2. Defensive Anchors (20%)**
- MCD/SBUX: Recession-resistant with global expansion potential
- LOW: Benefits from housing market trends, lower volatility than pure discretionary

**3. Premium/Lifestyle Bet (15%)**
- LULU/ULTA: Target affluent demographics less sensitive to economic cycles
- CMG: Premium fast-casual with digital transformation story

**4. Contrarian Value (12%)**
- Auto stocks (F/GM) for potential EV transition upside
- BBY for omnichannel retail transformation

**5. Specialized Retail (8%)**
- Off-price retail (TJX) performs well in various economic conditions
- Auto parts (ORLY/AZO) benefit from aging vehicle fleet

This allocation emphasizes quality growth while maintaining some defensive characteristics and value opportunities, potentially providing better risk-adjusted returns than a market-cap weighted approach.
