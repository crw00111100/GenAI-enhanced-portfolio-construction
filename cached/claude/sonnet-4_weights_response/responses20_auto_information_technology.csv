Here's a hypothetical allocation for a model portfolio designed to potentially outperform the S&P 500 Information Technology sector:

## Portfolio Allocation

**Large Cap Growth Leaders (40%)**
- MSFT: 12%
- AAPL: 10%
- NVDA: 10%
- AVGO: 8%

**High-Growth Disruptors (25%)**
- CRM: 6%
- NOW: 5%
- PANW: 5%
- CRWD: 4%
- ADBE: 3%
- FTNT: 2%

**Semiconductor Value Play (20%)**
- AMD: 8%
- QCOM: 5%
- AMAT: 4%
- TXN: 3%

**Contrarian/Turnaround Bets (10%)**
- INTC: 4%
- IBM: 3%
- HPQ: 3%

**Defensive Stalwarts (5%)**
- ORCL: 3%
- INTU: 2%
- CSCO: 0%

**Total: 100%**

## Underlying Strategy & Logic

**1. Overweight AI/Cloud Infrastructure**
- Heavy allocation to NVDA, MSFT, and AMD to capitalize on the AI boom
- These companies have strong moats in critical infrastructure

**2. Growth at Reasonable Price (GARP)**
- Emphasizing companies with strong growth prospects but avoiding extreme valuations
- Balanced exposure across different growth stages

**3. Secular Trend Positioning**
- Cybersecurity overweight (PANW, CRWD, FTNT) for long-term security needs
- Cloud/SaaS focus (CRM, NOW, ADBE) for digital transformation

**4. Contrarian Value Opportunities**
- Small positions in INTC and IBM betting on successful turnarounds
- These could provide asymmetric upside if transformation succeeds

**5. Diversification Across IT Subsectors**
- Balanced exposure to software, hardware, semiconductors, and services
- Reduces concentration risk while maintaining growth focus

**6. Quality Bias**
- Emphasis on companies with strong balance sheets, recurring revenue, and competitive advantages
- Underweight or exclude more cyclical/commodity-like businesses

This allocation aims to outperform through active sector rotation, growth stock selection, and strategic contrarian positions while maintaining reasonable diversification.
