Here's a hypothetical allocation for a consumer staples portfolio designed to potentially outperform the S&P 500 Consumer Staples sector:

## Portfolio Allocation

**Large Cap Core Holdings (60%)**
- WMT: 15.0% - Dominant retail position, e-commerce growth
- PG: 12.0% - Premium brands, consistent innovation
- KO: 10.0% - Global brand strength, dividend aristocrat
- PEP: 10.0% - Diversified portfolio, snacks growth
- COST: 8.0% - Membership model, pricing power
- MDLZ: 5.0% - International snacking exposure

**Growth & Innovation Focus (25%)**
- MNST: 8.0% - Energy drink category leadership
- MKC: 6.0% - Spices/seasonings growth, flavor trends
- SYY: 6.0% - Foodservice recovery, supply chain efficiency
- TSN: 5.0% - Protein demand, operational improvements

**Defensive Dividend Players (15%)**
- CL: 4.0% - Oral care leadership, emerging markets
- KMB: 3.0% - Essential products, stable cash flow
- GIS: 2.5% - Pet food growth, brand portfolio
- CHD: 2.0% - Household essentials, consistent performance
- CLX: 1.5% - Cleaning products, health focus
- HRL: 1.0% - Refrigerated foods, protein alternatives
- K: 1.0% - Cereal stabilization, snacking pivot

**Minimal Allocations (Total: 0%)**
- CAG, CPB, SJM: 0% each - Structural headwinds in categories

## Strategy Logic

**1. Quality & Moat Focus**: Overweight companies with strong competitive advantages (WMT's scale, COST's membership model, PG's brand portfolio)

**2. Growth Tilt**: Higher allocation to faster-growing segments like energy drinks (MNST), spices (MKC), and foodservice recovery (SYY)

**3. Avoid Declining Categories**: Zero weight in companies facing structural challenges in traditional packaged foods

**4. Dividend Quality**: Balance growth with reliable dividend payers for total return

**5. International Exposure**: Favor companies with strong global presence for diversification

This allocation aims to capture both defensive characteristics of staples while tilting toward growth and quality to potentially outperform the broader sector index.
