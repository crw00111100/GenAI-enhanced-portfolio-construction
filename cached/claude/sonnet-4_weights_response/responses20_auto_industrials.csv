| NOC   | 4.0%   | Northrop Grumman |
| FDX   | 4.0%   | FedEx |
| GD    | 3.5%   | General Dynamics |

| CSX   | 3.0%   | CSX Corporation |
| MMM   | 2.5%   | 3M Company |
| BA    | 2.0%   | Boeing |

**Total: 100.0%**

## Underlying Strategy & Logic

### 1. **Quality & Stability Focus (40% allocation)**
- **UNP, NSC, CSX**: Railroads benefit from oligopolistic market structure and essential infrastructure role
- **HON, ETN, EMR**: Diversified industrials with strong recurring revenue streams and technological moats

### 2. **Secular Growth Themes (30% allocation)**
- **RTX, LMT, NOC, GD**: Defense spending resilience and aerospace recovery
- **CAT, DE**: Infrastructure spending and agricultural technology trends
- **ITW, PH**: Automation and industrial efficiency themes

### 3. **Cyclical Recovery Play (20% allocation)**
- **UPS, FDX**: E-commerce logistics and supply chain normalization
- **GE**: Turnaround story with aviation recovery and renewable energy exposure
- **ROK**: Industrial automation beneficiary

### 4. **Defensive Positioning (10% allocation)**
- **MMM**: Underweight due to litigation concerns and slower growth
- **BA**: Minimal allocation due to ongoing regulatory and production challenges

## Key Strategic Principles:

1. **Overweight quality companies** with strong balance sheets and predictable cash flows
2. **Favor secular growth trends** over pure cyclical plays
3. **Diversify across sub-sectors** to reduce concentration risk
4. **Underweight troubled names** while maintaining some exposure for potential recovery
5. **Emphasize companies with pricing power** and technological advantages
