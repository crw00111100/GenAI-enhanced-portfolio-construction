Here's a hypothetical portfolio allocation for these consumer discretionary stocks with a growth-oriented, quality-focused strategy:

## Portfolio Weights:

**Core Holdings (50%)**
- AMZN: 0.15 (15%)
- HD: 0.10 (10%)
- NKE: 0.08 (8%)
- MCD: 0.07 (7%)
- SBUX: 0.05 (5%)
- LOW: 0.05 (5%)

**Growth & Innovation (25%)**
- TSLA: 0.08 (8%)
- CMG: 0.04 (4%)
- LULU: 0.04 (4%)
- ABNB: 0.03 (3%)
- DPZ: 0.03 (3%)
- ULTA: 0.03 (3%)

**Value & Defensive (15%)**
- TJX: 0.04 (4%)
- ROST: 0.03 (3%)
- YUM: 0.03 (3%)
- ORLY: 0.03 (3%)
- AZO: 0.02 (2%)

**Contrarian/Turnaround (10%)**
- BKNG: 0.04 (4%)
- F: 0.03 (3%)
- GM: 0.03 (3%)

**Total: 1.00 (100%)**

## Strategy & Logic:

**1. Quality Tilt with Growth Focus**
- Overweight companies with strong competitive moats, consistent cash flows, and secular growth trends
- AMZN gets the highest weight due to its dominant e-commerce position and AWS growth
- HD and LOW benefit from sustained housing/renovation trends

**2. Digital Transformation Winners**
- Emphasis on companies successfully adapting to digital commerce (NKE, SBUX, CMG)
- Technology-forward retailers (ULTA, LULU) that blend physical and digital experiences

**3. Underweight Traditional Retail**
- Lower exposure to pure-play discount retailers (ROST, TJX) despite their defensive qualities
- Reduced auto exposure (F, GM) due to cyclical concerns and EV transition risks

**4. Selective High-Growth Exposure**
- Moderate TSLA position to capture EV growth while managing volatility
- ABNB for travel recovery and sharing economy trends
- CMG and DPZ for their strong unit economics and digital ordering capabilities

**5. Risk Management**
- Diversification across sub-sectors (e-commerce, restaurants, specialty retail, auto, travel)
- Balance between growth stocks and defensive names
- Limited exposure to highly cyclical or disrupted segments

This allocation aims to outperform by focusing on companies with sustainable competitive advantages, strong digital capabilities, and exposure to long-term consumer trends while maintaining reasonable diversification.
