- Industrial/logistics REITs (20%) benefit from e-commerce growth and supply chain evolution

**2. Secular Trend Alignment**
- Focus on REITs with exposure to long-term structural trends rather than cyclical plays
- Underweight traditional retail and office (5%) due to ongoing headwinds

**3. Quality Over Yield**
- Prioritize REITs with strong balance sheets, development pipelines, and pricing power
- EQIX, DLR, and PLD get top weights due to mission-critical nature of their properties

**4. Demographic Plays**
- Residential REITs (20%) positioned for millennial household formation
- Healthcare REITs (10%) aligned with aging demographics

**5. Risk Management**
- Diversification across property types and geographies
- Limited exposure to COVID-impacted sectors (office, hotels)
- Focus on REITs with long-term triple-net leases and creditworthy tenants

This hypothetical allocation aims to outperform by overweighting structural growth stories while maintaining defensive characteristics through diversification and quality focus.
