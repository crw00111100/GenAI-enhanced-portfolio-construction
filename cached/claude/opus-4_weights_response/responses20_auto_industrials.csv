- **ODFL (Old Dominion Freight)**: 0.08
- **CAT (Caterpillar)**: 0.07
- **UNP (Union Pacific)**: 0.07
- **TDG (TransDigm)**: 0.06
- **LMT (Lockheed Martin)**: 0.06
- **HON (Honeywell)**: 0.06
- **PWR (Quanta Services)**: 0.05
- **AME (AMETEK)**: 0.05
- **CSX (CSX Corporation)**: 0.05
- **RTX (Raytheon)**: 0.05
- **ETN (Eaton)**: 0.05
- **DE (John Deere)**: 0.05
- **UPS (United Parcel Service)**: 0.04
- **CARR (Carrier Global)**: 0.04
- **NSC (Norfolk Southern)**: 0.04
- **UBER (Uber Technologies)**: 0.03
- **FDX (FedEx)**: 0.03
- **GE (General Electric)**: 0.02
- **BA (Boeing)**: 0.02

**Total**: 1.00

## Underlying Strategy:

This hypothetical allocation follows a **Quality Growth with Risk Management** approach:

### 1. **Overweight High-Quality Compounders (35%)**
- WM, ODFL, CAT, UNP, TDG receive the highest weights due to:
  - Consistent revenue growth
  - Strong competitive moats
  - Pricing power
  - Stable cash flows

### 2. **Core Defensive Holdings (22%)**
- LMT, HON, PWR, AME provide:
  - Defense sector exposure (recession-resistant)
  - Diversified industrial exposure
  - Strong balance sheets

### 3. **Balanced Transportation/Infrastructure (23%)**
- CSX, RTX, ETN, DE, UPS, CARR, NSC offer:
  - Infrastructure spending beneficiaries
  - Economic cycle diversification
  - Mix of rail, aerospace, and logistics

### 4. **Underweight Challenged Names (10%)**
- UBER, FDX, GE, BA receive lower weights due to:
  - Higher volatility
  - Execution risks
  - Competitive pressures
  - Balance sheet concerns

### Key Principles Applied:
- **Quality bias**: Favoring companies with strong ROE and ROIC
- **Secular growth themes**: Waste management, e-commerce logistics, infrastructure
- **Risk management**: Underweighting cyclical or troubled companies
- **Diversification**: Maintaining exposure across industrial subsectors

This theoretical allocation aims to outperform by tilting toward higher-quality names while maintaining sector diversification and reducing exposure to higher-risk positions.
