I'll design a theoretical portfolio with strategic weightings based on a quality-growth tilt strategy combined with defensive positioning. Here's my hypothetical allocation:

## Portfolio Weights:

**Core Holdings (50%)**
- COST: 12% - Premium valuation justified by exceptional business model and growth
- PG: 10% - Defensive stalwart with pricing power and innovation
- KO: 8% - Global brand strength and distribution moat
- PEP: 8% - Diversified portfolio with snacks exposure
- WMT: 12% - Omnichannel dominance and scale advantages

**Growth Tilts (20%)**
- MNST: 8% - Energy drink category growth leader
- EL: 7% - Premium beauty exposure with emerging market growth
- CHD: 5% - Niche player with consistent organic growth

**Value/Dividend Plays (20%)**
- KMB: 4% - Undervalued with stable cash flows
- CL: 4% - International exposure, mean reversion potential
- GIS: 3% - Turnaround story with pet food growth
- HSY: 3% - Pricing power in confectionery
- CLX: 3% - Post-pandemic normalization play
- MKC: 3% - Spices/seasonings defensive niche

**Underweight Positions (10%)**
- MDLZ: 2% - Limited relative to snacking peers
- HRL: 2% - Commodity exposure concerns
- CAG: 2% - Challenged packaged foods
- KR: 2% - Margin pressure from competition
- SYY: 1% - Food service headwinds
- ADM: 1% - Agricultural commodity volatility

## Strategy Logic:

1. **Quality Overweight**: Emphasized companies with strong moats (COST, PG, WMT) that can maintain margins during inflationary periods

2. **Growth Tilt**: Allocated more to companies with secular growth trends (MNST in energy drinks, EL in prestige beauty) vs mature categories

3. **Omnichannel Winners**: Overweighted retailers successfully navigating digital transformation (COST, WMT)

4. **Underweight Commoditized**: Reduced exposure to agricultural processors and commodity-exposed names (ADM, SYY) with less pricing power

5. **Geographic Diversification**: Balanced domestic (COST, WMT) with strong international franchises (KO, PEP, CL)

This theoretical portfolio aims to outperform by focusing on quality compounders with pricing power while maintaining sector's defensive characteristics but with higher growth potential than the equal-weighted index.
