## Strategy Logic

My allocation strategy is based on several key factors:

1. **Sector Diversification**: I've balanced exposure across different real estate subsectors:
   - Industrial/Logistics (PLD): 9%
   - Data Centers/Tech (EQIX, DLR): 15% 
   - Cell Towers (AMT, CCI, SBAC): 19%
   - Retail (SPG, O, FRT, REG, KIM): 19%
   - Residential (AVB, ESS, INVH): 13%
   - Storage (PSA, EXR): 11%
   - Healthcare (WELL, VTR): 8%
   - Office (ARE, BXP): 6%

2. **Secular Growth Trends**: Overweight in sectors with strong long-term growth potential:
   - Data centers and cell towers (32% combined) to capitalize on digital transformation and 5G expansion
   - Industrial/logistics (9%) to benefit from e-commerce growth
   - Reduced exposure to traditional office space (6%) given work-from-home trends

3. **Quality Focus**: Higher allocations to REITs with:
   - Strong balance sheets
   - High-quality property portfolios in prime locations
   - Proven management teams
   - Track records of dividend growth

4. **Income and Growth Balance**: Balanced between:
   - Stable income generators (O, WELL, VTR)
   - Growth-oriented REITs (EQIX, AMT, PLD)

This hypothetical allocation aims to potentially outperform by strategically overweighting subsectors with favorable long-term tailwinds while maintaining sufficient diversification across the real estate landscape.
