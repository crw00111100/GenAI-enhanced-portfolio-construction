| Ticker | Company | Weight |
|--------|---------|--------|
| JPM | JPMorgan Chase | 0.09 |
| V | Visa | 0.08 |
| MA | Mastercard | 0.08 |
| BRK.B | Berkshire Hathaway | 0.08 |
| BLK | BlackRock | 0.07 |
| SPGI | S&P Global | 0.06 |
| PGR | Progressive | 0.06 |
| GS | Goldman Sachs | 0.06 |
| MMC | Marsh & McLennan | 0.05 |
| CME | CME Group | 0.05 |
| MS | Morgan Stanley | 0.05 |
| ICE | Intercontinental Exchange | 0.05 |
| AJG | Arthur J. Gallagher | 0.04 |
| CB | Chubb | 0.04 |
| PNC | PNC Financial Services | 0.04 |
| BAC | Bank of America | 0.03 |
| WFC | Wells Fargo | 0.03 |
| TRV | Travelers | 0.02 |
| MTB | M&T Bank | 0.01 |
| PYPL | PayPal | 0.01 |
| **Total** | | **1.00** |

## Strategy and Logic

This allocation follows a multi-factor approach designed to potentially outperform the SP500-40 financials index:

1. **Payment Networks Overweight (16%)**: Visa and Mastercard receive higher allocations (8% each) due to their strong network effects, high margins, and continued growth in electronic payments globally.

2. **Quality Factor Focus**: Emphasizes companies with strong balance sheets, consistent earnings, and competitive moats:
   - JPMorgan (9%) as the strongest large bank with diversified revenue streams
   - Berkshire Hathaway (8%) for its diversified holdings and capital allocation excellence
   - BlackRock (7%) for its dominance in asset management and ETF business

3. **Market Infrastructure Tilt (16%)**: Companies that provide essential financial market infrastructure:
   - SPGI (6%) for ratings and index businesses with high margins
   - CME (5%) and ICE (5%) for their exchange and data businesses

4. **Insurance Sector Optimization (17%)**: Progressive (6%) receives higher weight due to its technology advantage in auto insurance, complemented by MMC (5%), AJG (4%), and CB/TRV (6% combined).

5. **Investment Banking Balance (11%)**: Goldman Sachs (6%) and Morgan Stanley (5%) for their wealth management transitions and trading capabilities.

6. **Traditional Banking Underweight (16%)**: Lower allocations to traditional banks (JPM excepted) due to interest rate sensitivity and regulatory constraints.

7. **Tactical Positioning**: Minimal exposure to PYPL (1%) due to competitive pressures in fintech, and reduced exposure to regional banks like MTB (1%).

This allocation aims to capture secular growth trends in financial technology and market infrastructure while maintaining sufficient diversification across financial subsectors.
