## Strategy and Logic

This allocation follows a "Concentrated Growth with AI/Semiconductor Tilt" strategy with these key principles:

1. **Overweight Market Leaders (40%)**: Allocating significant weight to the three dominant tech companies (MSFT, AAPL, NVDA) that have strong market positions, robust cash flows, and leadership in AI and cloud computing.

2. **Semiconductor Focus (25%)**: Higher allocation to semiconductor companies (NVDA, AVGO, AMD, TXN, MCHP, MPWR) given the AI revolution, data center growth, and increasing chip demand across industries.

3. **Enterprise Software Emphasis (20%)**: Significant allocation to cloud and enterprise software leaders (CRM, ADBE, NOW, INTU) that benefit from recurring revenue models and digital transformation trends.

4. **Cybersecurity Premium (6%)**: Allocation to cybersecurity leaders (PANW, FTNT) reflecting the growing importance of security in an increasingly digital world.

5. **Chip Design Ecosystem (6%)**: Including electronic design automation leaders (SNPS, CDNS) that are critical to the semiconductor design process.

6. **Networking Infrastructure (3%)**: Allocation to networking companies (ANET, CSCO) that support cloud and AI infrastructure buildout.

7. **Lower Weight to Legacy Tech (2%)**: Minimal allocation to more mature tech companies (IBM, HPQ) that may face growth challenges but provide some portfolio diversification.

This theoretical allocation aims to outperform by concentrating on high-growth areas within technology, particularly AI, cloud computing, and semiconductors, while maintaining some exposure across the broader tech ecosystem.
