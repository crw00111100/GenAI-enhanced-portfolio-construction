## Strategy Rationale

My allocation strategy combines several investment approaches:

1. **Innovation-Weighted Approach**: I've allocated higher weights to companies with strong pipelines and innovative treatments (LLY, VRTX, REGN) that are likely to drive future growth.

2. **Balanced Subsector Exposure**: The portfolio maintains exposure across:
   - Pharmaceuticals (JNJ, LLY, MRK, BMY)
   - Biotechnology (AMGN, VRTX, REGN, GILD)
   - Medical Devices (ISRG, BSX, EW, SYK, MDT, DXCM)
   - Health Insurance/Services (UNH, ELV, CVS, CI)
   - Diagnostics (IDXX)

3. **Growth-Value Balance**: Combining established dividend payers (JNJ, MRK) with high-growth companies (ISRG, VRTX).

4. **Overweighting Secular Trends**: Higher allocations to companies positioned in:
   - Diabetes care and obesity treatments (LLY)
   - Oncology innovation (MRK, AMGN)
   - Robotic surgery (ISRG)
   - Rare disease treatments (VRTX, REGN)

5. **Defensive Positioning**: Maintaining significant exposure to companies with stable cash flows and lower volatility (JNJ, UNH) to provide downside protection.

This theoretical allocation aims to outperform by emphasizing innovation-driven growth while maintaining sufficient diversification across healthcare subsectors.
