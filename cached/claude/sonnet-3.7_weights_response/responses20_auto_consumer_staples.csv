## Strategy Logic

This hypothetical portfolio is designed with a multi-factor approach that aims to outperform the standard S&P 500 Consumer Staples index through:

1. **Growth-Defensive Balance (60/40 split)**:
   - 60% allocation to companies with stronger growth profiles (COST, MNST, EL, STZ, MDLZ)
   - 40% allocation to traditional defensive staples with stable dividends

2. **Overweight on Modern Retail**: Higher allocations to COST and WMT (21% combined) based on their omnichannel strength, warehouse models, and ability to navigate inflation environments.

3. **Beverage Sector Emphasis**: Combined 23% to KO, PEP, and MNST, balancing traditional beverage leaders with higher-growth energy drink exposure.

4. **Premium/Luxury Exposure**: Increased weight to EL (6%) for exposure to premium personal care, which tends to have higher margins and more pricing power.

5. **Underweight on Processed Foods**: Reduced exposure to traditional packaged food companies (GIS, CPB, CAG, SJM) which face margin pressures and changing consumer preferences.

6. **E-commerce Readiness**: Favoring companies with strong direct-to-consumer and digital capabilities.

This allocation strategy seeks alpha through emphasizing companies with pricing power, strong market positions, and adaptation to changing consumer behaviors, while maintaining sufficient diversification across the consumer staples subsectors.
