# Theoretical Consumer Discretionary Portfolio Allocation

Here's a hypothetical weight allocation for a portfolio of SP500-25 consumer discretionary stocks:

| Ticker | Company | Weight |
|--------|---------|--------|
| AMZN | Amazon | 0.15 |
| HD | Home Depot | 0.09 |
| TSLA | Tesla | 0.09 |
| MCD | McDonald's | 0.07 |
| BKNG | Booking Holdings | 0.07 |
| LOW | Lowe's | 0.06 |
| ORLY | O'Reilly Automotive | 0.06 |
| CMG | Chipotle | 0.05 |
| NKE | Nike | 0.05 |
| TJX | TJX Companies | 0.05 |
| LULU | Lululemon | 0.05 |
| SBUX | Starbucks | 0.04 |
| ULTA | Ulta Beauty | 0.04 |
| ROST | Ross Stores | 0.03 |
| YUM | Yum! Brands | 0.03 |
| RCL | Royal Caribbean | 0.02 |
| CCL | Carnival | 0.02 |
| EXPE | Expedia | 0.01 |
| EBAY | eBay | 0.01 |
| F | Ford | 0.01 |
| **Total** | | **1.00** |

## Strategy/Logic Behind the Allocation

My allocation strategy employs several principles to potentially outperform the index:

1. **Overweight E-commerce and Digital Leaders**: Allocating 15% to Amazon recognizes its dominant position in e-commerce, cloud services, and multiple growth vectors. This is a bet on continued digital transformation of retail.

2. **Home Improvement Focus**: Combined 15% allocation to HD and LOW acknowledges the resilience of home improvement retailers, which tend to perform well across economic cycles and benefit from the aging U.S. housing stock.

3. **Quality and Moat Emphasis**: Higher weights to companies with strong competitive advantages and pricing power (BKNG, MCD, ORLY, CMG) that can weather inflationary pressures.

4. **Balanced Exposure to Discretionary Segments**: The portfolio maintains exposure across retail (TJX, ROST), dining (MCD, SBUX, CMG, YUM), travel (BKNG, RCL, CCL, EXPE), and specialty retail (LULU, ULTA, NKE).

5. **Moderate EV Exposure**: 9% allocation to Tesla provides exposure to the electric vehicle transition without overcommitting to this volatile segment.

6. **Reduced Weight to Cyclical Travel**: Lower allocations to cruise lines and travel companies (CCL, RCL, EXPE) compared to their index weights due to their higher sensitivity to economic downturns.

7. **Limited Exposure to Traditional Auto**: Minimal weight to Ford (1%) reflects challenges in the traditional auto industry amid the EV transition.

This allocation aims to balance growth opportunities with resilience during economic uncertainty, potentially allowing for outperformance across different market environments.
