### Key Allocation Strategy & Logic
1. **Overweight High-Growth Subsectors (Total: 45%)**:
   - **Data Centers/Cell Towers (40%)**: Largest allocation to AMT, CCI, EQIX, DLR, and SBAC. Driven by secular trends (5G, cloud computing, AI). These assets have high barriers to entry and pricing power.
   - **Industrial (12%)**: PLD dominates e-commerce logistics. Supply-chain resilience supports warehouse demand.

2. **Moderate Allocation to Resilient Niches (Total: 25%)**:
   - **Self-Storage (10%)**: PSA and EXR benefit from low operational costs and demand in economic volatility.
   - **Healthcare/Life Science (9%)**: WELL (aging population) and ARE (biotech R&D growth) offer recession-resistant cash flows.

3. **Selective Exposure to Traditional Sectors (Total: 20%)**:
   - **Residential (15%)**: Focused on high-quality apartment REITs (AVB, EQR) with urban/coastal exposure. Underweight smaller players (CPT, UDR, ESS).
   - **Retail (6%)**: Minimal allocation to SPG (premium outlets) and REG (grocery-anchored centers). Avoids low-growth mall anchors.

4. **Underweight Slower-Growth Areas**:
   - **Net Lease (3%)**: O is included for stability but capped due to limited growth upside.
   - **Lower-Priority Residential (4%)**: ESS, CPT, UDR receive minimal weights due to geographic or demographic headwinds.

5. **Quality and Valuation Filters**:
   - Prioritized companies with:
     - Strong balance sheets (e.g., AMT, EQIX, PLD).
     - >5-year FFO (Funds From Operations) growth above sector median.
     - Competitive moats (e.g., cell tower density, hyperscale data center leases).
   - Avoided highly leveraged names or those with stagnant dividends.

### Expected Outcome
This portfolio tilts toward **digital infrastructure** and **demand-resilient subsectors** while minimizing exposure to challenged areas (e.g., low-tier retail). The strategy targets **long-term secular growth drivers** (digitalization, healthcare innovation) and **operational quality** to outperform the broader real estate index. Historical backtesting would refine weights further, but this allocation balances growth potential with diversification.
