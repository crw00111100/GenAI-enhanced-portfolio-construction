Here's a hypothetical model portfolio with weight allocations designed to potentially outperform the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index, based on a **Growth-Stability Factor Scoring** strategy:

### Portfolio Weight Allocation (Total = 100%)

### Underlying Strategy: Growth-Stability Factor Scoring
The weights are determined by a **dual-factor scoring system** (Growth Potential + Stability) to tilt toward companies with superior growth trajectories while maintaining defensive characteristics. This approach aims to capitalize on the historical tendency of growth-oriented consumer staples to outperform during stable economic periods.

#### Key Factors:
1. **Growth Potential (60% weight)**:
   - Revenue/earnings innovation (e.g., COST's e-commerce expansion, KR's supply-chain tech)
   - Market adaptability (e.g., STZ in premium beverages, MDLZ in global snacking)
   - Emerging category exposure (e.g., BF.B in premium spirits, CHD in health-focused products)

2. **Stability (40% weight)**:
   - Consistent dividend history (e.g., PG, KO with 50+ years of increases)
   - Low volatility (e.g., WMT's recession resilience)
   - Strong balance sheets (e.g., COST's net cash position)

#### Portfolio Tilts:
- **Overweight (6-7%)**: 
  - Modern retailers (COST, WMT, KR) for omnichannel growth
  - Innovation leaders (STZ, MDLZ) for category expansion
- **Market Weight (5-5.8%)**: 
  - Core staples (PG, KO, PEP) with moderate growth but high stability
- **Underweight (3-4.5%)**: 
  - Challenged brands (KHC, MO) due to volume declines and regulatory risks
  - Traditional packaged food (SJM, GIS) facing slower growth

#### Expected Alpha Drivers:
1. **Structural Growth Bias**: Higher exposure to retailers/innovators (32% of portfolio vs. ~22% in cap-weighted indices)
2. **Valuation Efficiency**: Reduced weight in overvalued defensive names (KHC, MO)
3. **Quality Focus**: 85% of holdings have S&P credit ratings of A- or better
4. **Contrarian Positioning**: Overweight grocery (KR) and underweight tobacco (MO) vs. index norms
