Here’s a hypothetical example of how you might distribute the weightage of these 15 energy stocks in a model portfolio, along with the underlying strategy:

### **Hypothetical Portfolio Allocation (Normalized to 1.00):**
| Ticker | Weight (%) | Rationale |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **XOM**  | 15%        | Largest integrated oil major, strong balance sheet, dividend stability |
| **CVX**  | 14%        | Similar to XOM, global diversification, LNG growth exposure |
| **OXY**  | 10%        | High-growth Permian Basin exposure, Berkshire Hathaway backing |
| **COP**  | 9%         | Strong free cash flow, shareholder returns, low breakeven costs |
| **EOG**  | 9%         | Premier shale operator, disciplined capital allocation |
| **FANG** | 8%         | Permian pure-play, high production growth, efficient operations |
| **MPC**  | 7%         | Leading refiner with strong margins, buybacks |
| **DVN**  | 6%         | Undervalued E&P, improving capital efficiency |
| **WMB**  | 5%         | Stable midstream cash flows, key natural gas infrastructure |
| **OKE**  | 5%         | High-yield midstream, exposure to LNG demand growth |
| **SLB**  | 4%         | Leading oilfield services, international growth |
| **VLO**  | 3%         | Refining margins cyclical but strong in high-crack spread environments |
| **HAL**  | 2%         | Oilfield services recovery play, but higher volatility |
| **APA**  | 2%         | Higher-risk international E&P (Egypt, Suriname) |
| **BKR**  | 1%         | Smaller oilfield services player, more speculative |

### **Underlying Strategy & Logic:**
1. **Overweight Integrated Majors (XOM, CVX – 29%)**  
   - These companies provide stability, dividends, and diversified exposure to upstream, downstream, and LNG.
   - Historically resilient during downturns.

2. **High-Growth E&P Focus (OXY, EOG, FANG, COP, DVN – 42%)**  
   - Emphasis on Permian Basin players (OXY, FANG, EOG) due to long-term shale efficiency gains.
   - COP and DVN offer a mix of value and growth.

3. **Midstream (WMB, OKE – 10%)**  
   - Steady cash flows from pipelines, lower volatility than E&Ps.
   - Beneficiaries of rising natural gas/LNG demand.

4. **Refiners (MPC, VLO – 10%)**  
   - Cyclical but high-margin businesses in tight supply environments.
   - MPC is a leader with strong capital returns.

5. **Oilfield Services (SLB, HAL, BKR – 7%)**  
   - Underweight due to higher volatility and capex dependency.
   - SLB preferred for international exposure.

6. **Higher-Risk/High-Reward (APA – 2%)**  
   - Small allocation due to geopolitical risks but potential upside from exploration success.

### **Goal: Outperform SP500-10 Energy Index**  
- **Differentiation:** The index may be market-cap-weighted, favoring XOM/CVX heavily. This portfolio tilts toward higher-growth E&Ps and midstream while maintaining core stability.  
- **Factor Mix:** Balances value (XOM, CVX), growth (OXY, FANG), and yield (WMB, OKE).  
- **Cyclical Adjustments:** If bullish on oil prices, could increase E&P weights further.
