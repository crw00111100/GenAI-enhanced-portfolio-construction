Here’s a hypothetical example of how you might distribute the weightage of these 20 consumer staples stocks in a model portfolio, along with the underlying strategy:

### **Hypothetical Weight Allocation:**
| Ticker | Weight (%) | Rationale                          |
|--------|------------|------------------------------------|
| PG     | 12%        | Industry leader, strong dividends  |
| KO     | 10%        | Global brand, stable cash flows    |
| PEP    | 10%        | Diversified portfolio, growth      |
| MO     | 8%         | High dividend yield                |
| PM     | 8%         | International exposure             |
| CL     | 7%         | Premium household brands           |
| STZ    | 6%         | Growth in alcoholic beverages      |
| MDLZ   | 6%         | Snacking trends, global presence   |
| KMB    | 5%         | Defensive, essential products      |
| HSY    | 5%         | Strong brand loyalty               |
| GIS    | 4%         | Stable demand, restructuring       |
| CAG    | 3%         | Value play, turnaround potential   |
| SJM    | 3%         | Underperformer, contrarian bet     |
| K      | 3%         | Cereal exposure, cost-cutting      |
| HRL    | 3%         | Protein-focused, defensive         |
| LW     | 2%         | Agricultural commodities play      |
| MKC    | 2%         | Premium spices, niche market       |
| CPB    | 2%         | Cheap valuation, high yield        |
| WBA    | 1%         | Struggling, speculative recovery   |
| TSN    | 1%         | Cyclical, lower weight due to risk |

**Total:** **100%**

### **Underlying Strategy & Logic:**
1. **Quality & Market Leadership (PG, KO, PEP, CL, KMB) – 44%**  
   - Higher weights to dominant players with strong pricing power, global reach, and consistent dividends.  
   - These stocks tend to be less volatile and provide stability.

2. **Growth & Niche Exposure (STZ, MDLZ, HSY, MKC) – 19%**  
   - Allocated to companies with above-average growth potential (e.g., STZ in beverages, MDLZ in snacks).  
   - HSY and MKC benefit from brand loyalty in confectionery and spices.

3. **High Dividend & Value (MO, PM, CPB, GIS) – 19%**  
   - MO and PM offer high yields, appealing for income investors.  
   - GIS and CPB are undervalued relative to peers, offering potential upside.

4. **Contrarian & Turnaround Bets (SJM, K, WBA, TSN) – 8%**  
   - Smaller allocations to stocks that may rebound (e.g., WBA if pharmacy model improves).  
   - TSN is cyclical, so kept at a minimal weight.

5. **Defensive & Essential Goods (HRL, CAG, LW) – 8%**  
   - HRL (protein) and CAG (packaged foods) are recession-resistant.  
   - LW is a smaller player but benefits from agricultural trends.

### **Goal: Outperformance vs. SP500-30 Consumer Staples Index**
- **Overweight Growth & High-Quality:** By giving higher weights to companies with strong brands and growth potential (PG, KO, PEP, STZ), the portfolio may outperform in stable or bullish markets.  
- **Dividend Focus:** MO, PM, and CPB provide income, which can compound returns over time.  
- **Selective Value/Contrarian Plays:** Smaller bets on undervalued names (SJM, WBA) could add alpha if they recover.  
- **Underweight Struggling Names:** WBA and TSN are kept minimal due to higher risk.  

This approach balances stability, growth, income, and selective value opportunities while avoiding excessive concentration in underperformers.
