| TFC    | Truist Financial           | 2%         | Merger synergies; regional exposure |

### Total Weight: 100%

### Underlying Strategy / Logic:
1. **Focus on Market Leaders**: Heavier weights to top-tier banks (JPM, BAC) and payment giants (V, MA) due to their scale, profitability, and growth.
2. **Growth vs. Value Balance**: Overweight high-growth fintech/payments (V, MA, PYPL) while retaining value picks (WFC, C) for diversification.
3. **Diversification Across Subsectors**: 
   - Banks (JPM, BAC, WFC, C, USB, PNC, TFC)
   - Capital Markets (GS, MS)
   - Payments (V, MA, PYPL)
   - Insurance (CB, AIG, MET)
   - Asset Managers (BLK, SCHW)
   - Financial Data (SPGI, MCO)
4. **Turnaround Potential**: Allocate smaller weights to undervalued stocks with catalysts (e.g., WFC, AIG).
5. **Quality Factors**: Preference for high-margin, low-capital-intensive businesses (V, MA, SPGI, MCO).
6. **Risk Management**: Avoid excessive concentration in any single stock (max 12% for JPM) or subsector.

### Outperformance Drivers:
- **Growth Exposure**: Visa, Mastercard, and S&P Global have higher growth potential than traditional banks.
- **Value Opportunities**: Wells Fargo and Citigroup could rebound if macro conditions improve.
- **Diversification**: Non-bank financials (insurance, asset management) provide stability.

This is a hypothetical, active strategy aiming to tilt toward quality, growth, and undervalued names while maintaining broad exposure to the financial sector. Actual performance would depend on market conditions and execution.
