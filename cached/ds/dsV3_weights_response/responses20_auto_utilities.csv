Here’s a hypothetical example of how you might distribute the weightage of these 20 utility stocks in a model portfolio, along with the underlying strategy:

### **Hypothetical Weight Allocation:**
| Ticker | Weight (%) | Rationale                          |
|--------|------------|------------------------------------|
| NEE    | 12%        | Leader in renewable energy (wind/solar), growth potential |
| DUK    | 8%         | Large regulated utility with steady dividends |
| SO     | 8%         | Strong Southeast presence, reliable earnings |
| D      | 7%         | Diversified operations, stable cash flows |
| EXC    | 6%         | Competitive in wholesale markets, nuclear exposure |
| AEP    | 6%         | Transmission-heavy, good regulatory support |
| PEG    | 5%         | Strong NJ/NY footprint, infrastructure investments |
| ED     | 5%         | Pure-play regulated utility (NY) |
| XEL    | 5%         | High renewable mix, strong Midwest/West presence |
| WEC    | 5%         | Above-average growth in renewables |
| ES     | 4%         | Smaller but stable New England utility |
| FE     | 4%         | Transitioning from coal, potential upside |
| ETR    | 4%         | Strong Louisiana/Texas presence |
| AWK    | 4%         | Water utility (defensive, low volatility) |
| CNP    | 3%         | Smaller regulated utility, steady performer |
| SRE    | 3%         | California exposure, LNG growth potential |
| DTE    | 3%         | Michigan-focused, transitioning to renewables |
| PPL    | 3%         | UK/US mix, decent yield |
| ATO    | 3%         | Smaller but well-run Southern utility |
| EIX    | 2%         | California wildfire risk (underweight) |

**Total:** **100%**

### **Underlying Strategy & Logic:**
1. **Growth Overweight (NEE, WEC, XEL, DUK, SO)**  
   - Higher weights to utilities with strong renewable energy investments (NextEra Energy, Xcel, WEC) due to long-term growth potential.  
   - Duke Energy and Southern Co. get higher allocations due to scale and regulatory stability.

2. **Balanced Core Holdings (D, EXC, AEP, PEG, ED)**  
   - Diversified utilities with stable cash flows and reasonable valuations.  
   - Slightly higher weight to AEP due to transmission investments.

3. **Defensive & Lower-Risk (AWK, ES, CNP, PPL, ATO)**  
   - Water utility (AWK) for low volatility.  
   - Smaller, well-managed utilities with steady dividends.

4. **Underweight Riskier Names (EIX, FE, SRE)**  
   - EIX is underweighted due to California wildfire risks.  
   - FE is transitioning from coal, so moderate weight.  
   - SRE has LNG upside but regulatory risks.

5. **Avoiding Excessive Concentration**  
   - No single stock exceeds 12% (NEE), reducing idiosyncratic risk.  
   - Most weights between 3-8% for diversification.

### **Goal: Outperform the SP500-55 Utilities Index**
- **Higher Growth Exposure:** Overweighting renewables (NEE, XEL, WEC) to capture secular trends.  
- **Dividend Stability:** Maintaining a mix of high-yield, regulated utilities (DUK, SO, D).  
- **Risk Management:** Underweighting high-risk names (EIX) while keeping sector diversification.  

This is a **hypothetical** allocation based on fundamental factors—actual performance would depend on market conditions, rebalancing, and unforeseen risks.
