Here’s a hypothetical example of how you might distribute the weightage of these 20 energy stocks in a model portfolio, along with the underlying strategy:

### **Hypothetical Portfolio Allocation (Normalized Weights)**
| Ticker | Weight (%) | Rationale                          |
|--------|-----------|------------------------------------|
| XOM    | 12%       | Large-cap, diversified, stable cash flows |
| CVX    | 12%       | Strong balance sheet, global operations |
| FANG   | 8%        | High-growth Permian Basin exposure |
| EOG    | 8%        | Premium shale operator, low breakeven |
| COP    | 8%        | Strong free cash flow, shareholder returns |
| MPC     | 7%        | Refining margins, strong profitability |
| VLO     | 7%        | Downstream strength, valuation upside |
| OXY     | 6%        | Berkshire Hathaway backing, carbon capture focus |
| PSX     | 5%        | Refining & midstream diversification |
| KMI     | 5%        | Stable midstream cash flows, high yield |
| WMB     | 4%        | Natural gas infrastructure growth |
| DVN     | 4%        | Free cash flow focus, buybacks |
| HES     | 3%        | Guyana offshore growth potential |
| CTRA    | 3%        | Low-debt, gas-weighted producer |
| SLB     | 2%        | Oilfield services, international exposure |
| HAL     | 2%        | N. America-focused services |
| BKR     | 2%        | Tech-driven oilfield services |
| EQT     | 1%        | Natgas volatility risk |
| APA     | 1%        | Int'l exposure (Egypt, Suriname) |
| TRGP    | 1%        | Midstream, smaller cap |

**Total** → **100%**

### **Underlying Strategy & Logic**
1. **Large-Cap Stability (XOM, CVX – 24% combined)**  
   - These are the two biggest energy stocks with strong dividends and resilience to oil price swings.  
   - Provide downside protection in volatile markets.

2. **Growth & Shale Focus (FANG, EOG, COP – 24% combined)**  
   - High-quality Permian Basin operators with low breakevens.  
   - Emphasis on free cash flow generation and buybacks.

3. **Refining & Downstream (MPC, VLO, PSX – 19% combined)**  
   - Refiners benefit from crack spreads and global fuel demand.  
   - Cyclical upside potential if margins remain strong.

4. **Midstream & Infrastructure (KMI, WMB – 9% combined)**  
   - Fee-based cash flows provide stability.  
   - Natural gas demand growth supports WMB.

5. **High-Risk, High-Reward (OXY, HES, DVN – 13% combined)**  
   - OXY has carbon capture potential.  
   - HES has Guyana upside, DVN has strong FCF yield.  

6. **Limited Exposure to Oilfield Services (SLB, HAL, BKR – 6% combined)**  
   - Services are more cyclical, so underweighted.  
   - SLB gets slightly more due to international diversification.

7. **Minimal Weight to Speculative Plays (EQT, APA, TRGP – 3% combined)**  
   - Higher geopolitical or commodity risk justifies lower allocation.

### **Goal: Outperform SP500-10 Energy Index**
- **Overweight Growth & Refining:** The index may be more evenly distributed, but this portfolio tilts toward FANG, EOG, and refiners (MPC, VLO) for higher upside.  
- **Underweight Services & Small Caps:** These tend to underperform in downturns.  
- **Balanced Stability & Aggression:** Enough weight in XOM/CVX to reduce volatility while still capturing upside from growth names.
