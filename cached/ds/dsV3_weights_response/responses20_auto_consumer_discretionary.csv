Here’s a hypothetical example of how you might distribute the weightage of these 20 stocks in a theoretical model portfolio designed to potentially outperform the S&P 500-25 Consumer Discretionary Index. The weights are based on a combination of factors such as growth potential, market leadership, and relative valuation.

### **Hypothetical Weight Allocation:**

| Ticker | Weight (%) | Rationale |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| AMZN   | 15%        | Dominant in e-commerce and cloud, high growth potential. |
| TSLA   | 10%        | Leader in EVs and energy, high volatility but high upside. |
| HD     | 8%         | Strong home improvement sector, stable growth. |
| NKE    | 7%         | Global brand strength in apparel and footwear. |
| MCD    | 6%         | Resilient business model, global fast-food leader. |
| LOW    | 5%         | Complementary to HD, steady performer. |
| SBUX   | 5%         | Strong brand, global coffee demand. |
| BKNG   | 5%         | Leading online travel, high-margin business. |
| ORLY   | 5%         | Auto parts retail benefits from aging vehicle fleet. |
| DHI    | 4%         | Homebuilder with strong U.S. housing demand. |
| ULTA   | 4%         | Beauty retail growth, loyal customer base. |
| LEN    | 4%         | Another strong homebuilder, cyclical upside. |
| ROST   | 4%         | Off-price retail resilient in economic downturns. |
| F      | 3%         | Legacy automaker with EV transition potential. |
| GM     | 3%         | Similar to Ford but with stronger EV pipeline. |
| EBAY   | 3%        | E-commerce niche player, undervalued. |
| MAR    | 3%         | Global hospitality recovery play. |
| CMG    | 3%         | High-growth restaurant chain. |
| AZO    | 3%         | Auto parts retailer with strong cash flows. |
| DPZ    | 3%         | Resilient pizza delivery, steady performer. |

**Total:** **100%**

### **Underlying Strategy / Logic:**
1. **Growth Overweight (AMZN, TSLA, NKE, CMG, BKNG, ULTA)** – Higher allocation to high-growth companies with strong competitive advantages.
2. **Cyclical Exposure (HD, LOW, DHI, LEN, ORLY, AZO)** – Beneficiaries of housing and auto aftermarket trends.
3. **Defensive Balance (MCD, SBUX, DPZ, ROST)** – Resilient businesses that perform well in downturns.
4. **Recovery Plays (F, GM, MAR, EBAY)** – Potential upside from economic reopening and cyclical rebounds.
5. **Avoid Overconcentration** – No single stock exceeds 15%, reducing idiosyncratic risk.
6. **Valuation Consideration** – Some weights adjusted for relative valuation (e.g., EBAY at 3% vs. AMZN at 15%).

### **Goal:**
This allocation aims to:
- Outperform by overweighting high-growth and cyclical stocks.
- Maintain diversification to reduce volatility.
- Capitalize on sector trends (e.g., e-commerce, EVs, housing).
- Balance between growth and value to mitigate downside risk.
