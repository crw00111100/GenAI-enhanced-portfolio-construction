| **REGN** | Regeneron                  | 6.5%       | High-growth biologics (Eylea, Dupixent) |
| **AMGN** | Amgen                      | 6.0%       | Biosimilars & rare disease pipeline |
| **MRK**  | Merck                      | 5.5%       | Keytruda dominance, vaccine pipeline |
| **ISRG** | Intuitive Surgical         | 5.0%       | Robotics surgery leader, high margins |
| **VRTX** | Vertex Pharmaceuticals     | 4.5%       | Cystic fibrosis monopoly, gene therapy potential |
| **BSX**  | Boston Scientific          | 4.0%       | Medtech innovator (cardio, neuromodulation) |
| **MDT**  | Medtronic                  | 3.5%       | Stable medtech, restructuring upside |
| **HUM**  | Humana                     | 3.0%       | Medicare Advantage growth |
| **ELV**  | Elevance Health            | 3.0%       | Managed care with cost efficiencies |
| **GILD** | Gilead Sciences            | 2.5%       | HIV franchise, oncology pipeline |
| **ZTS**  | Zoetis                     | 2.0%       | Animal health leader (defensive) |
| **IQV**  | IQVIA                      | 1.5%       | CRO exposure (leveraged to pharma R&D) |
| **BMY**  | Bristol-Myers Squibb       | 1.0%       | Patent cliffs, underweighted |
| **MRNA** | Moderna                    | 0.5%       | High volatility, post-COVID uncertainty |

**Total Weight:** **100%**

### **Underlying Strategy & Logic**
1. **Growth Overweight (50% of portfolio):**  
   - Highest weights to **LLY, UNH, REGN, VRTX, ISRG** due to strong revenue growth (e.g., GLP-1 drugs, biologics, robotics).  
   - Avoids value traps (e.g., **BMY**) facing patent cliffs.

2. **Quality & Stability (30% of portfolio):**  
   - **JNJ, ABBV, TMO, DHR** for diversified cash flows, high margins, and R&D moats.  
   - **UNH, ELV, HUM** for defensive managed care exposure.

3. **Cyclical & Turnaround Bets (15%):**  
   - **MDT, BSX, GILD** for medtech recovery and pipeline optionality.  
   - Underweight **MRNA** due to uncertain post-COVID demand.

4. **Risk Management:**  
   - No single stock >12% (limits idiosyncratic risk).  
   - Underweights low-growth/high-leverage names (**BMY, MRNA**).  

5. **Sector Trends:**  
   - Overweight **biotech (LLY, REGN, VRTX)** and **life sciences tools (TMO, DHR)** to capitalize on innovation.  
   - Underweight **traditional pharma (BMY, MRK)** due to slower growth.

### **Expected Outcome vs. SP500-35 Healthcare Index**
- **Potential Outperformance Drivers:**  
  - Higher exposure to GLP-1/obesity (LLY), managed care (UNH), and medtech (ISRG).  
  - Avoids laggards (e.g., BMY’s patent losses).  
- **Risks:**
